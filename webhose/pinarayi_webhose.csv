Since LDF enoys a comfortable majority, its candidate will sail through. 
Veerandra Kumar had earlier resigned from his seat in December after Nitish Kumar joined the NDA. The Veerendra Kumar-led JD(U) also severed its ties with the UDF in Kerala.

(Photo: ARUN CHANDRABOSE) Kochi: The urgent need for legislation to prevent data misuse and personal safety in transportation are some of the key themes that have emerged in the sessions held as part of the global digital summit #Future on Thursday. The panellists on Data: Oil of the Digital Future focused mainly on the enormous opportunity as well the threat factors in a data-based economy and lifestyle. Alok Ohrie president and managing director India Dell EMC said the very nature of the social media and the lack of restrictions on usage implied that it could not really be termed a “misuse” if the data is used for commercial purposes.
“An urgent reform of the law will safeguard the interest of the users,” he said, noting that Indians are particularly vulnerable because so many people are active social media users. Kris Gopalakrishnan, member, Kerala High Power IT Committee, was of the opinion that governments could not entirely evade responsibility on this issue, and legislation and regulations to stop data misuse needed to be a priority. Suku Nair, Director, SMU AT&T Centre for Virtualisation, Dallas, Texas, said a good part of the responsibility of safeguarding data lay with the users themselves. “You don’t leave your wallets or valuables lying around. The same kind of consideration needs to be given to data as well,” he said.
Sajan Pillai, CEO, UST Global, Kerala, said about big opportunities in the field of data, “We may have lost our chance with industry, but we will not miss the digital opportunities.” He added, IT industry was sorely in need of data processing professionals. Raw data, like oil, needs to be processed to make it usable, said Devadas Varma, founder and CEO, entrinsia Inc. Ramadas Pillai, president and CEO, Nuphoton Technologies, said state government has to look actively into easing the difficulties for companies in raising funds and growing here.
Customer-centric needs will power advancements in digitisation and technology in travel and transportation sector, and businesses will have to design their technologies around individualised user experience and safety, experts said. Christoph Mueller, chief digital and innovation officer - Emirates Group, who set the tone of the discussion said hyper-personalisation would be the new industry requirement marked user experience (UX) design, automated operations and enhanced safety.
""We will have completely new customer segments with 30 percent of passengers being active seniors who have retired with good incomes and are travelling the world; commuter profiles will change, and global migrants and a middle-class with massive purchasing power will drive the technology,” he said. Roland Schuetz, group CIO – Lufthansa Group, echoed the sentiments by stating that from the consumers' point of view, travel has to be as easy as possible and seamless, and technology may function behind the scenes.",english

His comments assume significance in the wake of the ongoing stir in Keezhattur village in Kannur district where 'Vayalkilikal', a residents' collective, is opposing reclamation of paddy fields for the construction of a National Highway bypass.
“The government wants to implement all those developments projects which won’t affect environment for ensuring a better living condition to the future generation. “However, certain sections are out with protests. They are bent upon creating hurdles to development projects which are need of the hour,” Vijayan said, while launching the state’s first CNG fuel outlet here. The chief minister pointed out that the vehicle population in the state is growing at an alarming rate and the road couldn’t handle the traffic volume, resulting in heavy traffic congestion in towns and cities. “The current state of roads and the public transportation should improve drastically if we wanted any solution,” he said.
Meanwhile, Pinarayi Vijayan said the government would take all steps for propping up the loss-making Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, including rolling out more CNG buses. Transport Minister A K Saseendran too said the government would roll out 1000 CNG buses in the first phase, the funds for which are already allocated in the budget. “A director board meet of the KSRTC on Monday will decide on purchase of 900 new buses. It will also include CNG buses. Converting to the green fuel will not only cut the operating expense but also will help in operational efficiency,” he said.
The RTC will also roll out CNG buses for operating superclass buses once the Green Tribunal issues verdict regarding conversion to clean fuel in big cities.

The state government until a few days ago was mulling to file a review petition against February 16th verdict seeking high allocation of water even though the SC verdict was slightly favourable to Karnataka. Former PM HD Deve Gowda too had reacted that the government must file a review petition.
The political leaders including union ministers and parliamentarians from Karnataka advised the government that it must go by the advice of state’s legal team while vehemently opposing the formation of Cauvery Management Board.

Kerala on Thursday filed a review petition in the Supreme Court in connection with the Cauvery water dispute. Last month, the apex court gave its verdict on the sharing of the Cauvery waters between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Congress-led opposition on Thursday slammed the Pinarayi Vijayan government for aligning with Adani Ports who are going to execute the proposed Rs 7,525-crore Vizhinjam project. 
Congress legislator M. Vincent, in whose constituency (Kovalam) the port is coming up, sought leave for an adjournment motion in the Kerala Assembly and pointed out that the state government was just playing into the hands of Adani by not taking appropriate action as the project was now going to be delayed by 18 months. 
“As per the contract which was inked under the former Oommen Chandy government on August 17 2015, the port was scheduled to open on December 5, 2019. But last month, Adani Ports wrote to the state government that due to Ockhi disaster, two of their dredgers were damaged and on account of the shortage of limestone, they need an extension of 18 months,” said Vincent. 
He said as per the agreement, Adani Ports will have to pay a compensation of Rs 12 lakhs if they did not finish the project by the agreed date of completion, 
But the penalty cannot be enforced if there was a natural disaster or shortage of raw material. 
“While replying to a question in the Assembly last month, Minister of Ports K. Ramachandran said the work at the port might be delayed due to Ockhi and the non-availability of limestone. What was more surprising that after a week of the statement, Adani Ports wrote to the state government that they needed the extension, the government and Adani were hand in glove,” said Vincent. 
However, Ramachandran has denied that the government has aligned with anyone. 
“There is a high-powered committee under the chief secretary which is monitoring the port work. Damages have taken place and there was a serious shortage of limestone also. But we are not going to allow any extension as we are confident that they will be able to complete it on time,” the minister said. 
Leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala said: “An agile and alert government would have made appropriate intervention and supported the project by ensuring supply of raw materials… We clearly set out strict terms and conditions and now you are diluting it by joining hands with Adani. This is cheating…” (IANS)",english

Voting in the crucial biennial elections for 25 seats in the Rajya Sabha is currently on in six states today. These elections are important as they can help the union government get more seats in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament. This will help the government consolidate their position in the house. Voting will be held till 4 PM and counting will be taken up an hour later. 
All eyes are on the Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal elections as many leaders like Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi are contesting from these states respectively. Karnataka, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Telangana will also feature in the polls. 
One candidate each of the ruling BJP and opposition Congress will battle for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Chhattisgarh. Kerala will also see an election for a single seat. In Telangana, legislators will select among four for the three seats going to polls. In this state, the BJP are giving the elections a miss. 
Five candidates are in the electoral arena in Karnataka for four seats. The state’s ruling Congress has fielded three nominees, BJP and JD(S) have fielded one candidate each. Elections will also be held for two seats in Jharkhand where three candidates are in the fray, including two of the state’s ruling BJP and one of the Congress. 
UP votes 
Voting for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh began today. To secure a seat to the Upper House from this state, a candidate needs 37 first preference votes. The BJP is expected to sweep this election. 
The BJP and its allies have 324 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the saffron party can easily bag eight of the 10 seats and will still be left with 28 surplus votes as the the four-MLA strong Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has decided to go with the ruling party. “There can be some contest on the ninth seat,” a senior UP BJP leader said. 
The Samajwadi Party, which has fielded Jaya Bachchan, and the BSP, which nominated Bhimrao Ambedkar, appeared confident of winning one each of the remaining two seats.BJP candidates in the fray from Uttar Pradesh are Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Ashok Bajpai, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Sakal Deep Rajbhar, Kanta Kardam, Anil Jain, Harnath Singh Yadav, G V L Narasimha Rao and Anil Kumar Agarwal. 
The Apna Dal (Sonelal), with nine MLAs, has also decided to vote for the BJP nominees. “We are standing with the BJP. We held a meeting of our MLAs and it was decided that we will strongly support the BJP,” national president of Apna Dal (S) Ashish Patel had told PTI . The declaration of support from the Apna Dal (S) came days after SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, a Cabinet minister in state government, declared his party’s support for the BJP candidates. 
The country’s most populous state sends 31 MPs to the 245-member Rajya Sabha, and the BJP, which won a massive victory in the 2017 Assembly elections, is yet to get a lion’s share of these. 
Voting in West Bengal 
Voting for the five Rajya Sabha seats from West Bengal is underway in the Assembly here, with six candidates, including Congress nominee Abhishek Manu Singhvi, in the fray. A candidate requires 49 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. Polling started at 9 AM. 
The Trinamool Congress (TMC), which has fielded four candidates—Nadimul Haque, who was renominated, Subhasish Chakraborty, Abir Biswas and Santunu Sen—has announced its support to Congress’ Singhvi for the fifth seat. 
Senior CPI(M) leader Rabin Deb is contesting as the Left Front candidate for the fifth seat. 
The Congress has 42 MLAs in the 295-member West Bengal Legislative Assembly while the Left Front had 32 legislators, but two of them joined the TMC. 
Election to the five Rajya Sabha seats from the state was necessitated as the terms of Kunal Ghosh, Bibek Gupta and Nadimul Haque of the TMC and Tapan Sen of CPI(M) will end on April 2. Mukul Roy, who quit the TMC and joined the BJP last year, has already resigned from the Rajya Sabha. Voting in Kerala 
Voting for the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Kerala is underway. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan being among the early voters. M P Veerendra Kumar, the state president of the Janata Dal (U) Sharad Yadav faction, is the candidate supported by ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, while B Babu Prasad is the UDF candidate. 
In the 140-member Assembly, the LDF has 90 MLAs while the UDF has 41 legislators. Kerala Congress (M), which has six MLAs will abstain from voting. O Rajagopal, the lone BJP MLA in the state, will keep away from exercising his franchise. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala, former chief minister, Oommen Chandy, and state ministers were among those who voted. 
The election is being held after the seat fell vacant when Veerendra Kumar resigned from the Upper House of Parliament as a mark of protest following JD(U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar joining hands with BJP-led NDA Published on",english

Replying to a question by C K Saseedran (CPI-M), Vijayan said it had not been brought to the notice of the government that the trainee police personnel were given ‘uncivilised’ punishments at the training college. 
Steps to revise the police training manual were also on, the Chief Minister added.

KSRTC’s first CNG bus rolls out 
The first CNG bus of the KSRTC was launched by Transport Minister A K Saseendran at a function here on Thursday.”The first CNG bus is being launched on a test basis. However, the KSRTC will introduce more such buses soon. As far as KSRTC is concerned, 50 per cent of its daily revenue is spent on fuel. By introducing CNG, the KSRTC can reduce its expenditure considerably,” he said. 
He said a meeting of the KSRTC board will be held on Saturday in which a proposal will be put forward for buying 900 new buses. “Among these 900 buses, we will include CNG buses as well. There has been a proposal to buy 1,000 CNG buses in the state budget. But, even after a year, the buses could not be bought as there were no fuelling stations in Kerala then. Once more fuelling stations are opened, we will introduce more buses,” he said. 
A K Saseendran travelled in the new CNG bus parked on the SCMS College campus. The bus (registration number KL 15A 2173) will start services from Friday. Painted in white with green and yellow strips, it will start from Vyttila at 6.10 am and will end the trip at Aluva around 5.30 pm daily. The bus will ply on Vyttila-Vyttila circular route and will be parked at the KSRTC Aluva workshop. 
Made by Ashok Leyland, the bus can seat 48 persons. With six cylinders to store 75 kg of CNG, it can operate for 200 km after filling fuel. The engine of the bus produces 145 BHP power and it can operate at the speed similar to buses run on diesel on city roads. First CNG fuel station opened at Kalamassery 
Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will set up 25 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fuel stations in the central and northern parts of the state in the next two years while about two lakh households will get piped natural gas connections by the end of 2020. Making the clean fuel available, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday launched the state’s first CNG fuel station at the IOC’s retail fuel outlet at Kalamassery. 
He also inaugurated virtually three more CNG refilling stations — at Container Road, Kalamassery, Pulinchodu (Opposite to KSRTC Garage), Aluva, and Maradu, Kundannur, at a function held at SCMS, School of Business, Cochin. 
“CNG as a domestic and industrial fuel was introduced in Ernakulam in 2016. About 2500 households have been provided with PNG (Piped Natural Gas) connections in and around Kalamassery. We aim to provide PNG connection to two lakh houses in two years,” said S.K. Sharma, chairman of Indian Oil-Adani Gas Pvt Ltd (IOAGPL), tasked to supply PNG in Kochi. 
The chief minister also launched ‘Vipinam’, the green initiative under which vertical gardens and plant nurseries will be grown in IOC fuel outlets across the state. It also promotes the distribution of plants instead of bouquets during events.

To secure a seat to the Upper House of Parliament from this state, a candidate needs 37 first preference votes.

Win or Lose, Mayawati Will Make a Powerful Statement With UP Rajya Sabha Results | Lakhna, on the borders of Chambal ravines, is a non-descript town 20 kilometres from Etawah. On an upswing after four years of Samajwadi Party rule since 2003, Mayawati was throwing a serious challenge to Mulayam Singh Yadav, even in his own backyard in Yadav dominated constituencies of central Uttar Pradesh. By some queer stroke of luck or maybe design, Behenji nominated Bhim Rao Ambedkar to take on the SP from Lakhna in 2007. If politics is about perception and messaging, then Mayawati succeeded in doing precisely that by winning a comfortable majority in the state and getting Ambedkar elected from Mulayam’s bastion. In 2018, when Mayawati fights, perhaps, the toughest political battle in decades, she has once picked B R Ambedkar from Lakhna to knit a strong narrative irrespective of the outcome of the polls. There is a strong historic link to Ambedkar’s selection in 2018 Rajya Sabha elections. This history has been a part of the Dalit narrative as it sought to carve a niche for itself through various strands of identity politics. Mar 23, 2018 2:39 pm (IST) 
Rajya Sabha candidate of Janata Dal (Secular) BM Farook demands cancellation of Rajya Sabha elections 2018 in Karnataka, alleging that the returning officer is favouring Karnataka Congress Mar 23, 2018 2:31 pm (IST) 
Replying to Janata Dal (Secular) President HD Kumaraswamy, Karnataka Congress said that both the old MLAs were old. JD(U) MLAs have made a mistake by writing in roman numbers. Now, as they don't want their vote to go waste so they are requesting for a fresh paper Mar 23, 2018 2:05 pm (IST) 
Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah was seen walking all the seven rebel MLAs to the polling booth. Janata Dal (Secular) President Kumaraswami cries foul play, says Election Commission must countermand these elections. ""Two senior Congress leaders cross voted in the first ballot paper. Returning officer allowed them to vote again in fresh ballot paper. Illegal voting is going on, requested EC Observer to counter mandate the process."" HD Kumaraswamy said. On Thursday, Janata Dal (Secular) asked the High Court to disqualify the rebel MLAs, but the High Court refused to intervene as the election process had already begun. Before Karnataka heads for Assembly Elections, the state will see four Rajya Sabha seats heading to polls. A candidate requires the vote of 46 MLAs in the house to get elected. With 124 MLAs, the ruling Congress party will elect 2 MPs and have 32 balance votes left. The BJP (44) is two votes short of the required number but can pull off at least one win with the help of the JD(S) (39). The BJP, JD (S), BSRC, KJP and KMP have 90 MLAs, which is still two votes short of what is required to elect 2 MPs. However, the NDA may be able to pull off a second seat with the help of independents. Mar 23, 2018 2:05 pm (IST)

Raising the issue in the state assembly, the opposition alleged the government had sanctioned 211 days of parole in the last nine months to P K Kunjananthan, the 13th accused in the case related to murder of RMP leader T P Chandrasekharan. The government was now trying to give him remission citing his old age, it charged. The UDF said it would pursue legal course if the government went ahead with its 'move' violating Constitutional provisions and earlier court verdicts in similar cases. Chandrasekharan, a CPI(M) rebel who floated the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP), was hacked to death in May 2012 near his hometown Onjiyam in Kozhikode district. Several of the accused in the case were local CPI(M) workers, besides goons hired to execute the murder. Vijayan, in his brief reply, denied the charge and said the opposition was making ""unnecessary allegations"". The issue would be relevant only if such a remission was granted. ""The government has not given direction to award remission of sentence to any prisoner. The remission will not be awarded to any prisoner without considering all relevant legal aspects,"" he added. He also said there was no government or political level intervention in granting parole to prisoners. Seeking to table a notice for an adjournment motion, Sunny Joseph (Congress) said appeals seeking more stringent punishment to the accused in the case were pending before the Kerala High Court and the government could not grant remission to them in such a circumstance. Kunjananthan, a senior CPI(M) leader, was a 'close friend' of the Chief Minister, he alleged. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Chief Minister was trying to trivialise the issue by giving a brief reply. ""Even after he was jailed, the CPI(M) has given Kunjananthan several key party posts. He also took part in various party programmes during the time of paroles violating norms,"" Chennithala charged. He also alleged that besides Kunjananthan, all the accused in the cruel political murder case were given 'wellness treatment' inside the prison by the LDF government. The opposition later staged a walkout as Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan disallowed the motion.",english

In fact, even the website of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) uploads PDF files containing copy of Aadhaar from people. This flood of leakages raise serious questions on the entire Aadhaar system, when Attorney General KK Venugopal and UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, are trying to impress the five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court about safety and security of the UID. The leakages data revealed on the first search page, belongs to MeitY itself. It looks like the Ministry headed by Mr RS Prasad believes in revealing personal details of Right to Information (RTI) applicants rather than furnishing complete information on UIDAI or Aadhaar project itself. Remember, UIDAI has still not revealed under RTI details about its contract with foreign agencies or enrolment agencies they have hired. However, MeitY is not the only government website that is leaking Aadhaar number and other data of citizens. The governments of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan as well as some specialised portals like the Systemized Administration & Regulation of Tendering and Handling All Court Cases (SARTHAC), Intellectual Property India are found leaking Aadhaar data of applicants. Interestingly, even the Delhi government led by Aam Admi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal seems to believe uploading personal information of RTI applicant, including Aadhaar is the right thing to do. Not to be left behind in transparency, the Rajasthan government headed by Vasundhara Raje Scindia from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also reveals personal information of RTI applicants on its website. When under the RTI Act, the applicant is not required to prove his or her identity, why the Rajasthan government is publishing such information on internet. The state government in Madhya Pradesh headed by Shivraj Singh Chouhan from BJP believes in publishing personal information like Aadhaar and PAN of promoter and developer under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). In implementing central government schemes, the government from Kerala, headed by Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has uploaded entire PDF file containing application, Aadhaar, electoral card and copy of bank passbook of the applicant on its website. SARTHAC, which owned by High Court Cases Monitoring Cell of High Court of Calcutta, also seems to be uploading scanned copies of cases including personal information of people involved in the matter. Intellectual Property India too appears to have failed to understand rights of individuals and publishes all details on its website. This includes application forms, as well scanned copy of Aadhaar of those filing affidavits. Last time, when the issue of leakages of Aadhaar information on internet was raised, the UIDAI had shirked its responsibility by saying that by knowing someone’s Aadhaar, no one can impersonate and harm anybody. In addition, the UIDAI CEO told the Supreme Court that they are ignorant about purpose and details of transction being undertaken by various entities using Aadhaar.",english

As global digital summit #FUTURE drew to a close here on Friday, there stood a giant board at the reception featuring the images of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, and economist Raghuram Rajan. 
From a distance, it looks like a painting. But get closer, and it emerges that the images on the 8.5X5ft-size board were made of thousands of small pictures, 2,100 to be specific, of size 52mmX.36mm taken using a custom-designed mobile app. 
The board, quite aptly named Magic Wall, is a crowd-created art driven by Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. “It is an innovative way to engage guests at events. They can pose for as many as eight photographs, which are then printed in real time with the help of what is called a ‘magic tower’. The guests can then affix the photographs printed in the form of stickers on the board corresponding to the numbers printed on stickers indicating their location on the board,” said Joseph Babu, marketing director of Riafy Technologies Private Limited, a start-up that developed the technology. 
The initiative definitely had captured the imagination of the guests. For, the blank board was filled with photographs in the first six hours of the opening day, throwing up the three prominent figures to the fore in the process. 
Mr. Babu said that Magic Wall could be custom-made and printed in vinyl or acrylic to be preserved as a souvenir. It is being increasingly used for diverse events ranging from marriages, receptions, and product launches to summits, and the dominating images will be designed according to demand. For instance, when put up alongside a marriage venue, the images of the bride and the bridegroom will emerge when the board gets filled up. 
It is possible to configure the wall online or offline. When connected to the Internet, it enables to take printouts of pictures from social media platforms like Instagram, thus enabling a person to make his presence even when he is at a faraway place.",english

Krishnakumar,Start-ups all set to rake in big money,"March 23, 2018 20:45   14:21 IST more-in Price fixed for nearly 25 products and solutions to be integrated into govt departments 
Start-ups in Kerala have something to cheer about. The government has fixed the price for nearly 25 products and solutions developed by home-grown start-ups and these would be integrated into its various departments as per specific requirements, M. Sivasankar, Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Secretary, Electronics and IT Department, told The Hindu on the sidelines of the #Future digital summit that concluded here on Friday. 
Mr. Sivasankar said that government departments had already purchased eight to 10 such solutions of the nearly 25 solutions. 
Start-up culture 
“We had received nearly 60 ideas/solutions developed by the start-ups at a mega Idea Demand Day held in Kozhikode. The process of evaluating the efficiency of some other ideas proposed by the start-ups is progressing,” he said. 
Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder and former CEO of Infosys, said a culture of setting up a start-up has taken root in Kerala. 
“A start-up becomes successful over a period of 5 to 7 years. It does not happen in one or two years. Kerala embarked on this journey about four-five years ago. We are seeing signs of the first phase. Byju’s is a good example. There would be others,” Mr. Gopalakrishnan, who is also member of the State’s High-Power IT Committee (HPIC), told The Hindu . 
Vibrant ecosystem 
Stating that the State needs a vibrant ecosystem for start-ups not only for creating jobs but also for disruptive innovations, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said he was very confident that some of them will become successful, large and create employment. “Start-ups bring innovations to the market. That is also very relevant,” he said. 
Nasscom president R. Chandrashekhar said the Kerala government could encourage the start-up ecosystem in the State by adopting the solutions offered by the companies in its various programmes. 
Scale-up 
“For India, unless something is scaled up, it’s interesting to see but there is no impact. The impact is only when you have scale- up. And scale will come up only when its commercially viable or government is involved. The government has to indicate its interest and its willingness to integrate some of these solutions, because if the government integrates, you could do twice what you are doing now with the same amount of effort,” he said.",english

Elections to 25 seats in the Rajya Sabha took place on Friday in six States, including Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was virtually assured of eight of the 10 seats. 
For 58 seats, 33 candidates from 10 States were declared elected unopposed on March 15. Seven Union Ministers, including Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar, were among them. 
Besides Uttar Pradesh, where Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is in the fray and certain to win, the other States that are in the poll process are West Bengal, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. BJP gains in tight contest in U.P. 
In a photo-finish to the keenly watched Rajya Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP on Friday took a sweet revenge on the opposition by ensuring victory of all its nine candidates, days after it lost two crucial seats in the Lok Sabha bypolls in the state. 
The remaining seat went to the Samajwadi Party in the polls marred by cross-voting from both the sides, which led to the defeat of the BSP candidate in the prestigeous battle of ballots, touted as a test for the new-found bonhomie between the parties headed by Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Rai as saying. “The counting process has been held up after some complaints were raised on balloting,” according to an election official quoted by IANS. The counting was scheduled to begin at 5 p.m, an hour after the voting process was completed. 
In all, 400 of Uttar Pradesh’s 403 MLAs voted in the polls.

Mr. Kumar, who was supported by ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, polled 89 votes, while B Babu Prasad, Opposition UDF candidate, got 40 votes, official sources said. 
JD(S) cries foul in Karnataka 
The JD(S) has demanded countermanding of elections to four seats in Karnataka, alleging that the returning officer, in ‘collusion’ with the ruling Congress, allowed two of its members to recast their vote after they “cross-voted”. 
Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, however, termed the charge ‘false’, saying before casting their votes, the two MLAs realised they had made a “mistake” on the ballot paper, so they took another one for which “there is a provision in law”. 
Five candidates, three from the Congress and one each from the BJP and the JD(S) were in the fray for the four seats. 
As the poll process was on, JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy claimed that two senior Congress MLAs had “cross-voted” against their party’s official nominees by marking for another candidate on the ballot paper. 
However, on the request of the ruling party’s agent, the returning officer later allowed both the candidates to vote once again by issuing them a fresh ballot paper, he alleged. 
“Minister Kagodu Thimmappa, who was a former Speaker; and MLA Baburao Chinchansur have cross-voted in the first ballot paper, then they have shown it to their agent. “After seeing the cross- voting, the agent protested. Then the returning officer allowed these two voters to vote once again, second vote,” Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters. 
“We are protesting ...illegal voting is going on,” he said. The observer from the Election Commission has been requested to “countermand” the election process. Claiming that both Mr. Thimmappa and Mr. Chinchanasur wanted to vote against the Congress candidates, he alleged that the returning officer is “colluding” with the government. 
Rejecting the charge, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “It appears they [JD-S)] are desperate... they have tried every thing, they had gone to the court [on seven rebel JD-S) MLAs issue], they failed in the court, and desperately they are making these allegations.” 
The Chief Minister also expressed confidence that all three the Congress candidates will win the election, saying “we have enough votes on our side”. Voting ends in West Bengal

The TMC, which fielded four candidates -- Nadimul Haque, who was renominated, Subhasish Chakraborty, Abir Biswas and Santunu Sen -- had announced its support to Mr. Singhvi for the fifth seat. Senior CPI(M) leader Rabin Deb contested against him.

Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan Friday said man and society have always found ways to adapt to changing times even when there have been fears of machines replacing humans. 
“Two hundred years since the industrial revolution, jobs are still around. People and society adapt to do the things that machines cannot do…with technology, across every job there is going to be a restructuring, taking away the routine aspects and leaving the creative and customised aspects of that job,” said Rajan in a keynote session at #future, a global digital summit organised in Kochi by the Kerala government. 
Rajan added that fears of job losses due to machines replacing humans have existed since the industrial revolution, but never materialised till date. He championed the cause of India embracing digital transformation and in the process, taking the help of technology to provide more services to the poor.

“What jobs will humans be able to do in 10-15 years that are immune from threat? Jobs that require high intelligence and creativity; jobs that require human empathy and jobs where human working for us bolster our status in some way,” he said to a packed audience at the Le Meridien hotel in the city. 
Rajan, who served as RBI governor from 2013-16, stressed that the Indian government needs to do far more to ensure the growth of startups and businesses. 
Speaking at length on the developments in artificial intelligence and robotics, he said, “One of the big lacunae in this country is risk financing and so our start-ups go elsewhere because they need risk financing which is not available in this country. We have to make sure Indian capital is available because often it is closest to the ground and understands the financing better. We have to make sure that the companies of our future are incorporated in India, get Indian financing and expand significantly. We cannot miss out on the AI and Robotics revolution.”

In a lighter vein, he said that even in the current digital age, the government works with physical files as organisations are conservative. “I was told that the thicker the files are, the less you have to read them because they have been around for a while,” he said. 
Stressing that there has always been a ‘huge amount of hype’ associated with technology, the noted economist said the right conditions have to be created before they are brought in. He mentioned the death of a pedestrian in Arizona in the United States due to the involvement of a self-driving Uber car. 
“We always think the future will come faster than it comes. We often undertake experiments in very controlled conditions early on and succeed, and immediately extrapolate it to the much more complicated real world. For example, driverless cars and quantum computing will eventually come, but people will have to be convinced, and the right conditions will have to be created before they do,” he said in the keynote session. 
Later, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the summit, Rajan said technology must be utilised effectively by the government to do more for the poor and the marginalised. 
“If medical services become much cheaper, can every poor person now see a doctor effectively because some of the early diagnosis is done remotely and then the exceptions are dealt by the doctors. So they get access to better medical facilities than they have today. Medical is one place, education is another. If we can get quality products cheaper for the poor, we are one step ahead of where we are today,” he said. 
At a time when issues of data protection and privacy especially in connection to Aadhaar are spurring conversations in the country, Rajan said, “No technology is uniquely good or uniquely bad. It has certain aspects which need to be taken care of. I think the Supreme Court is currently looking at some of those aspects. Let’s wait and see what they do.” 
The #future global digital summit was conducted to pave the way for the digital transformation of Kerala, where internet penetration is highest in the country. Hundreds of delegates, entrepreneurs, startup founders and CEOs took part in panel discussions and deliberations at the summit. The two-day event was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday where he also launched a unified mobile app for citizens to utilise government services effectively. He vowed to embrace digital technology as a means of bridging the gap between the rich and the poor. For all the latest Business News , download Indian Express App More Top News ",english

Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) State general secretary Elamaram Karim has said that the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is trying to build an alternative to the Centre’s neo-liberal economic policies, such as reviving the public sector undertakings. 
In his address at the CITU general council meeting which began here on Friday, he said that many industries that went into serious crisis during the previous Congress-led United Democratic Front rule were coming back to the growth path now. 
“There is new life in the traditional sector. The government is intervening sincerely to retain in public sector the Centre-State public sector undertakings, which the Centre is trying to privatise,” he said. 
The declaration of the Left Democratic Front that the State government would not implement the anti-labour policies of the Centre and the steps taken by the government to increase the minimum wages in various sectors had brought cheer to workers. “However, the Centre is attacking the rights of workers by amending the existing labour laws. The State governments under the BJP rule are also taking away the rights of workers through labour law amendments. Even the right to organise is being denied,” he said. 
'Privatisation of PSUs gaining pace' 
Mr. Karim said the privatisation of PSUs was happening at an increased pace since the BJP government came to power at the Centre four years ago. Strategic sectors like the railways and defence are being privatised. The policy of the Modi government was to transfer the wealth of the nation to the hands of monopolists. The government was favouring the corporates who loot billions of rupees from banks, he alleged. 
In contrast to the Narendra Modi government taking decisions according to the diktats of imperialist financial capital, Mr. Karim said that the Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala was aiming at the comprehensive development of the State through the Nava Kerala Mission.",english

By: FE Bureau | Thiruvananthapuram | Published: March 24, 2018 2:48 AM The Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala was driven to the wall on Assembly floor this week by Opposition Congress-led UDF over any possible soft spot for Adani Group, after Adani Ports sought extension of deadline by 18 months. (Reuters) 
Adani Ports will not be allowed 18 months extension to the deadline for the completion of the Phase I of Rs 7,525-crore Vizhinjam Seaport, according to Kerala port minister Kadannappaly Ramachandran. If the December 2019 deadline is violated, the infrastructure company would have to cough up the contractual compensation. “At the same time, the LDF government would be ready to give the port developing partner company all assistance and support that is essential to accomplish the tasks in time,” the minister clarified. 
The Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala was driven to the wall on Assembly floor this week by Opposition Congress -led UDF over any possible soft spot for Adani Group, after Adani Ports sought extension of deadline by 18 months. By the contract signed under the former Oommen Chandy government on August 17, 2015, Adani Group is committed to commission the port on December 5, 2019. If this deadline is violated, the company will have to pay a compensation at the rate of Rs 12 lakh for each day of delay. 
“Last month, state’s port minister Kadannappally Ramachandran had told the Assembly that the work at the port was likely to be delayed because of the damages caused by Ockhi cyclone and the non-availability of limestone. It became obvious that LDF was playing cahoots with Adani Group since within a week of the state minister’s statement, Adani Ports sent a request urging that the deadline is deferred by 18 months,” M Vincent, Congress legislator of Kovalam constituency, where the port is under development, alleged. It is in response to this charge that the state port minister stated that the deadline violation would invoke the penalty clause. 
There is also an argument that since the project delay is due to a natural calamity, the compensation clause might not be invoked. Meanwhile, Adani Vizhinjam Port CEO Rajesh Jha has clarified that the company asked for extension of deadline, not to escape from paying the due compensation. “At present, it is hardly possible to commit when the construction will be over,” he says.

In an editorial titled ‘Uttar Pradesh Portents’ in CPM mouthpiece People’s Democracy, Karat said, “The UP byelections provide important lessons for the future in terms of election tactics to defeat the BJP...

The party ruled out “an understanding or electoral alliance with the Congress party” in its draft political resolution released earlier this year. In an apparent softening of stance, and an acknowledgement that any division of opposition votes only stands to benefit BJP, the party leadership has also emphasised that there is a need to ensure a pooling of anti-BJP votes, state-wise. Karat’s editorial also appears to open the doors to a likely realignment of anti-BJP forces in West Bengal and Tripura, where the Left faced a rout at hands of BJP.

Further, there are many contradictions among the regional parties in terms of policies and regional interests which will prevent all the regional parties coming together,” said Karat, in an indication that CPM may may no longer be enthusiastic about forging a‘ third front”. The sentiments for a realignment of political strategy were borne out by Kerala CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who, in a public address, made the same assertions about backing Congress — CPM’s arch rivals in Kerala — wherever the party was in a position to defeat BJP. The Kerala unit had earlier threw its weight behind Karat’s line, tipping the scales against Yechury’s stance for partnership with Congress.

Kunhananthan Kannur: Known for his conspiratorial skills in the red fortress of Kannur, P.K. Kunhananthan, 70, is the most ‘trustworthy’ comrade for all top CPM leaders from the district including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Though he was convicted in the TP Chandrasekharan murder, he spent only a few days in prison as he enjoyed parole at his will. The reported attempt by the LDF government to release him citing his age is not surprising to those who know the importance of Kunhananthan among party circles though he is merely an area committee member.
RMP leader K.K. Rema told DC that hectic moves were afoot to release Kunhananthan. “If Kunhananthan speaks out, the bloodstained past of many CPM leaders would be exposed”, she said, adding that the Kolavallur police from Panoor registered her statement as part of the procedures the other day and the officials of the social justice department registered her statement on Friday. “If Kunhananthan sneezes even Pinarayi would shiver,"" she said.
According to records sourced under Right to Information Act, between 2-6-2016 and 8-7-2017, Kunhananthan was on parole on an average for 16 days in a month. Kunhananthan was already out on parole for more than 300 days and of that, 211 days were during the current LDF regime.
This soft-spoken comrade was never arrested in any murder case earlier, although his name figured in atleast a dozen murder cases, in his political career spanning over more than four decades. It was only in the TP murder that he was accused, interrogated and arrested for the first time, finally getting the dubious title of ‘convict’.
It is to be recalled that CPM had ensured foolproof protection to Kunhananthan when police started tracking him in the TP murder. For almost 50 days, the CPM kept him hidden in party villages and when finally he surrendered, it was before the court evading the police. During the 1990s when the CPM-RSS clashes reached its zenith in Kannur, he had emerged as an essential element in the killing fields. Police officials including former Kannur SP Subhash Babu called him the ‘uncrowned king in CPM.’ Apart from hatching conspiracies, he also functioned as a ‘liaison officer’ between the police and the CPM, arranging culprits to be nabbed, presenting fabricated evidence and arraying weapons to be seized for the police.",english

There is neither political interference nor political discrimination in granting parole,” he told the Assembly on Friday. He was replying to the notice for an adjournment motion given by Mr Sunny Joseph (Congress) on the issue. The state government had included him in the list of prisoners above 70 years of age who would be given parole. Mr Vijayan did not take the name of Kunhananthan in his reply even once.
The Opposition staged a walkout protesting against the government's move to commute the sentence of Kunhananthan after Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan denied permission for the motion. During the discussions, the Opposition protested against Law Minister A.K. Balan for calling a Congress legislator as 'Nee' (not a respectable term in Malayalam). Following the protest, he withdrew the remark. Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala asked what was the message the government was trying to give by commuting the sentence of a murder convict.
Mr Kunhananthan was granted 217 days of parole in over two years, Mr Chennithala said. The UDF would pursue legal course if the government went ahead with its 'move' violating the constitutional provisions and earlier court verdicts in similar cases. Kunhananthan had taken part in various party programmes during the paroles violating norms, Mr Chennithala alleged. Besides Kunhananthan, all the accused in the political murder case were given 'wellness treatment' inside the prison by the LDF government, he said. “Kunhananthan is a close friend of the chief minister who is doing a favour to him because of that,” said Mr Chennithala.",english

(Photo: PEETHAMBARAN PAYYERI) Thiruvananthapuram: The election commission rejected the complaint filed by the UDF pointing out that three of the parties had not appointed their polling agents for the ongoing Rajya Sabha bypolls on Friday. The complaint submitted by the UDF resulted in delaying the counting by about one hour. Thus, the counting process which was scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. began only at 6 p.m.
Earlier, the Assembly secretary V.K. Babu Prakash rejected the opposition demand that the votes of the CPI, JDS and the NCP should not be counted as they had not appointed their polling agents. The UDF then moved the election commission.
The rule said that each of the members casting their vote should first show it to the polling agent appointed at the respective party’s polling station. The open vote is to avoid cross voting, but the complaint filed by the opposition was rejected saying that it was not mentioned in the election rules that a polling agent must be appointed.
The Assembly secretary also said that voting was the fundamental right of a person and that it was not mentioned in the rules as to whom the vote should be shown if a polling agent was absent. He added there was no such situation where the LDF’s vote would be rejected. The UDF had submitted the complaint as 24 votes belonging to the three parties would get rejected in case their plea was admitted making the elections a tight contest. Otherwise, the elections were an easy walk over for the LDF which had 90 members.",english

The opposition arrayed a series of reasons, both legal and ethical, against the move to cut short the life imprisonment court has awarded to Kunjanandan for his role in abetting the cold blooded political murder in 2012. “As per the Supreme Court orders, government cannot grant remission of sentence if any sort of appeal in connection with the case is pending with court. As far as the TP murder case is concerned, an appeal by TP’s wife Rema , seeking death sentence to the convicts, is pending with the court. Also, the convicts too have approached the court with appeal for revoking their sentence. If the government goes ahead with the plans to set Kunjanandan free, we will explore all possible legal options to veto the government move,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala . Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan refused to address the allegations directly but said all governments award remission of sentence to convicts, depending on certain aspects, including age and health. “Nobody needs to get worried. The remission of sentence, if granted to anybody, would only be given in conformity with the law. Nothing would take place in violation of the rules and procedures. So far, the government has not decided to set anybody free from jail,” he said. The opposition, however, said the matter of fact reply by the CM itself was indicative of the move to give remission of sentence to Kunjanandan. “If the government has no plans to set him free, why police recorded the statement of K K Rema? If the government thinks that anybody above 70 years of age is having some health issues and can be set free from jail, it would set a bad precedence,” Chennithala said.  ",english

Speaking after inaugurating the first compressed natural gas ( CNG ) fuel station in the state in Kochi on Thursday, Vijayan said that those who raise objection to projects which aim to bring in progress are anti-development.
Some people had raised objections to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) project as well, he said. “We have the obligation to hand over the country and its resources to the next generation in a better condition. So, we have to ensure the country’s development,” Vijayan said.
Our roads don’t have the capacity to cater to the increasing vehicular population. Many cities and town are choking with traffic. So, road development is the need of the hour. Public transport facilities also should be vitalized,” he said. Air pollution is on the rise. The introduction of CNG stations can address this to a certain extent, he said.
Transport minister A K Saseendran, delivering the keynote address, said that the director board of KSRTC which will be held on Saturday would approve the purchase of 900 buses. He said that at least 1,000 buses of the corporation would be converted to CNG in a year. “Around 50% of the KSRTC’s revenue is required for meeting its fuel expenses. So, introduction of CNG would be beneficial,” he said.
During the occasion, the chief minister inaugurated IOC’s green initiative ‘Vipinam’ that promotes the distribution of plants instead of bouquets during events and also making its retail outlets greener with vertical gardens and plant nurseries. The initiative is expected to reduce the carbon footprints of the corporation, said a company official.

He was inaugurating the UDF election convention at Chengannur on Thursday.
Chennithala said that the LDF government is behaving as if in a competition to open liquor outlets in every nook and corner of the state after the Chengannur election. He alleged that the state government is a complete failure in the state.
“The development of the state has come to a complete standstill. The LDF government is leading the state into a big debt trap. The law and order situation has also deteriorated. The state witnessed 23 political murders in the first 23 months of the LDF rule. After 2021, Pinarayi Vijayan will be known as the last communist chief minister of the country. Both the LDF and BJP are engaged in a killing spree. Youth Congress activist Shuhaib was murdered in Kannur with the knowledge of the CPM leadership,” Chennithala said.
Chennithala said that BJP-led NDA government is torturing religious minorities in the country. “Minorities are nowadays unable to live in states ruled by the BJP. They are facing large-scale violence in such states. Both the Centre and state governments are doing nothing to stop this,” he said. He urged the people to vote for a change in the forthcoming bypoll in Chengannur.

“Kerala is fast transforming into a knowledge-based society,” Vijayan said crediting the heights reached by the state on its robust public education system and the leading higher education institutions.
The internet has been declared citizens’ right and the government is committed to provide free wi-fi in at least 1,000 public spots every year, including parks and libraries. Also, the government is connecting offices and homes with a high-speed optical fibre network, the chief minister said.
“We have a wide range of highly qualified and skilled human resource and a world-class physical and digital infrastructure that can attract emerging knowledge companies,” Vijayan
said. The first global digital summit is a key step in showcasing Kerala as a global information and digital technology destination, he added.
Vijayan said Kerala, a rich blend of phenomenally beautiful natural living environment and a highly literate population, is showcasing before the world a 35 mn-strong population, who are connected and consumption ready.
“The summit also provides an opportunity for the state to showcase its multiple initiatives towards transforming it into a knowledge society. The Knowledge City in Thiruvananthapuram, the Maker Village here in Kochi and the Mobility Hub in Kozhikode are initiatives that I am sure will attract your attention,” the chief minister said.

March 24, 2018 
Malabar Group’s Mall of Travancore; Thiruvananthapuram’s first mall opened.. 
Mall of Travancore is located in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram city. Iconic Landmark, a lifestyle destination for 8 million people. More than 300 outlets of International Brands will spice up the retail experience in the Region offering delight to the new aspiring crowd burgeoning in the city. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday opened Malabar Group’s ‘Mall of Travancore,’ the capital’s first state-of-the-art shopping mall that has come up near Chakka on the National Highway 66 bypass. 
Spread over 6.5 lakh sq ft in three floors, the mall with over 150 stores of 300 brands has been set up at ₹400 crore on seven acres near the international terminal of Thiruvananthapuram airport. Seven multiplex theatres, Playaza — a 15,000 sq ft play area with 11 indoor rides, 9D theatre, 60 video kiosks — a hyper market, jewellery showrooms, electronics and home appliances showroom, showrooms of lifestyle products, and a food court with 22 multi-cuisine restaurants are the attractions. 
The Rs 10,000-crore mall in the state’s capital, described as India’s first green mall, harnessing a slew of environment-friendly initiatives. In its first phase, Mall of Travancore (MOT) incurred a cost of about Rs 400 crore. “Work on the second phase would start soon and will be complete by 2020,” says MP Ahammed, chairman, Malabar Group. “As much as 5% of the income generated would go to charity,” he says. 
Located at Chackai, right in front of the Trivandrum International Airport, the mall is a harbinger to many new development the city is going to witness in a few years. Unlike Kochi, the capital city has been a little behind in terms of mall culture. Yes we had Narmada shopping complex at Kowdiyar and TRIDA’s Saphalyam complex at Palayam. The latter is more of an extension of Connemara market. 
The next set of large shopping establishments in MG Road were more like large super markets and not exactly malls where a family could go to watch movies, shop at various branded stores and dine at the favourite restaurant chains. Mall of Travancore has all of it and its owner, The Malabar Group, is keen to provide an international shopping experience with a local flavour. 
The mall boasts of 300 outlets and 7 multiplex screens. The visitors are greeted by a large vertical garden, claiming to be the largest in the country. The garden itself costs the builder with Rs 2.5 crore. The mall functions from 10 am till 11 pm on weekdays and till 12 am on weekends. But the premises will be opened from 6 am onwards to welcome morning walkers to the 1.5 kilometre walkway. 
“We are creating a large hangout space of 60,000 square feet. We will be encouraging sale of local items such as vegetables, milk etc,” said Malabar Group chairman M P Ahammed. According to him the mall will see a lot of activities throughout the year. The celebrity visit starts with actor Dulquer Salmaan by the end of this month and it will be followed by a visit by Bollywood actor Kareena Kapoor in April. An array of cricketers and football players will also visit the mall.",english

The #future global digital summit, where hundreds of delegates, entrepreneurs, startup founders and CEOs took part in panel discussions, aimed at paving the way for the digital transformation of Kerala, where internet penetration is highest in the country. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan while inaugurating the two-day event on Thursday vowed to embrace digital technology as a means of bridging the gap between the rich and the poor.

Category: Advocacy , Human Rights , Justice , Kractivism , Law , Technology , UID Contrary to all claims from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Aadhaar number of several people continue to leak on the internet from government websites. In fact, even the website of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) uploads PDF files containing copy of Aadhaar from people. This flood of leakages raise serious questions on the entire Aadhaar system, when Attorney General KK Venugopal and UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, are trying to impress the five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court about safety and security of the UID. The leakages data revealed on the first search page, belongs to MeitY itself. It looks like the Ministry headed by Mr RS Prasad believes in revealing personal details of Right to Information (RTI) applicants rather than furnishing complete information on UIDAI or Aadhaar project itself. Remember, UIDAI has still not revealed under RTI details about its contract with foreign agencies or enrolment agencies they have hired. However, MeitY is not the only government website that is leaking Aadhaar number and other data of citizens. The governments of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan as well as some specialised portals like the Systemized Administration & Regulation of Tendering and Handling All Court Cases (SARTHAC), Intellectual Property India are found leaking Aadhaar data of applicants. Interestingly, even the Delhi government led by Aam Admi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal seems to believe uploading personal information of RTI applicant, including Aadhaar is the right thing to do. Not to be left behind in transparency, the Rajasthan government headed by Vasundhara Raje Scindia from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also reveals personal information of RTI applicants on its website. When under the RTI Act, the applicant is not required to prove his or her identity, why the Rajasthan government is publishing such information on internet. The state government in Madhya Pradesh headed by Shivraj Singh Chouhan from BJP believes in publishing personal information like Aadhaar and PAN of promoter and developer under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). In implementing central government schemes, the government from Kerala, headed by Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has uploaded entire PDF file containing application, Aadhaar, electoral card and copy of bank passbook of the applicant on its website. SARTHAC, which owned by High Court Cases Monitoring Cell of High Court of Calcutta, also seems to be uploading scanned copies of cases including personal information of people involved in the matter. Intellectual Property India too appears to have failed to understand rights of individuals and publishes all details on its website. This includes application forms, as well scanned copy of Aadhaar of those filing affidavits. Last time, when the issue of leakages of Aadhaar information on internet was raised, the UIDAI had shirked its responsibility by saying that by knowing someone’s Aadhaar, no one can impersonate and harm anybody. In addition, the UIDAI CEO told the Supreme Court that they are ignorant about purpose and details of transction being undertaken by various entities using Aadhaar. https://www.moneylife.in/article/your-aadhaar-details-are-leaked-by-government-websites-too/53484.html",english

The protest by farmers, which has come to be known as ‘Vayal kili’ (literally, paddy birds), caught the fancy of the general public in Kerala, who have been debating the issue on social media, opening up the CPM to widespread criticism.
The issue reached a flashpoint a few days ago when some miscreants set fire to a makeshift platform put up by the farmers to keep a vigil on the paddies. That incident was followed by stone-pelting at the residence of the farmers’ leader, Suresh Keezhattoor, which further stoked anger against the CPM and also against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who has strongly backed the road project.
The chief minister insisted the issue had been blown out of proportion and that 56 of the 60 families whose lands were to be acquired for the project were in favour of it. However, the protesters said that the chief minister’s claim was a lie.
Matters took a worse turn when minister for public works, G. Sudhakaran, said the agitators were “not birds, but vultures”, prompting political observer and lawyer Jaishankar to comment that Keezhattoor could turn out to be another Singur for the CPM, referring to the party’s debacle in West Bengal state after it tried to acquire land in Singur.
On Saturday, a compromise appeared to be near, with Sudhakaran writing to the federal government and the National Highways Authority of India, which will construct the road, asking whether it would be possible to construct an elevated highway to save the paddy fields.
While that possibility is explored, the CPM set about organising a rally in Keezhattoor on Saturday evening, even as the farmers were to be joined by environmentalists and others on Sunday in a counter rally demanding that the paddy fields be protected.",english

Even while saying that the state is going through a huge financial crisis, the LDF government seems to be less concerned about it when it comes to spending money so as to renovate the official residences of its ministers. According to reports, the government has spent a whopping sum of Rs 90 lakh for this purpose. It must be noted that the government has been receiving criticism for the expensive cars and the huge medical reimbursement bills claimed by its ministers. 
Earlier, RTI activist D B Binu had filed an RTI application following which the government has provided the details. According to the report, while Rs 8.48 lakh was spent on curtain works at the official residences of nine ministers, another Rs 82.35 lakh was spent on maintenance works at the residences of all ministers.

Reports suggest that Rs 2.07 lakh was spent for curtain works at Cliff House which is CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s official residence. Apart from this, Rs 1.51 lakh was spent for curtains at Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman’s residence while Rs.1.23 lakh for former Transport Minister Thomas Chandy’s residence. 
When it comes to maintenance, the most expensive maintenance of Rs 13.18 lakh was done at former minister E P Jayarajan’s residence Xanadu Bungalow. The residence of minister Kadakampally Surendran comes next with Rs 12.42 lakh while the lowest amount was spent at the official residences of PWD Minister G Sudhakaran (Rs 33,000) and Education Minister C Raveendranath (Rs 39,351). According to the RTI information, lakhs of rupees were spent at the residences of other ministers such as CM Pinarayi Vijayan K Raju, E Chandrasekharan, J Mercykutty Amma, K T Jaleel, A K Saseendran and V S Sunil Kumar. 
Binu accused that a huge amount of money is being looted by certain groups in the name of maintenance. He said,“There is a mafia operating hand in glove with the contractors, PWD officials and ministers’ staff to siphon off money in the name of maintenance works at the ministers’ residences.” He also demanded that a transparent system must be introduced so as to make sure that public money is spent in the most appropriate way.

Kerala is on the lookout for out of the box solutions for its development challenges, upholding its traditions of democracy, secularism and equity, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
He was speaking after launching the strategic think-tank and advisory body Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC) here on Saturday. 
Infrastructure deficit 
“The State is facing decades of infrastructure deficit. It has to address all these challenges within its precarious fiscal constraint and keeping in view its fragile environment. The human resource potential is unmatched. It is in this context that the government has reconstituted the Kerala State Innovation Council and established K-DISC,” said the Chief Minister said. 
He said K-DISC was simply not a change in name or leadership but a comprehensive change in its functional mechanism with extended responsibilities to assist the State in facing challenges and in preparing the new generation in taking up these challenges. 
“The mandate of the body has been enlarged from developing an information ecosystem to going beyond and developing innovation as an engine of prosperity. The State has identified tough challenges in waste management, building cost-effective shelter, ensuring affordable health care, raising quality of school education, making good use of its resources and developing industries around it. The K-DISC should be able to bring innovators together in all these areas and coordinate with the government’s four flagship missions and the departments working on it,” Mr. Vijayan said. 
Shashi Tharoor, MP, said: “The K-DISC should look at the prospect of strengthening the ecosystem for knowledge industry in the State capital. The State should encourage Indian innovators to come to Kerala by giving them the conditions in which they can do the innovative work which they do overseas. The focus should be innovations that are socially useful.” 
Anil Kumar Gupta, Chairman, National Innovation Foundation, said that Kerala should come up with a test procurement policy to provide funding to test prototypes developed by innovators. 
The Chief Minister also launched the Young Innovators Programme. A technical session was held on Blockchain Technology and the ways it can be used in governance. Another section highlighted the plans to position Kerala as a medical device and technology hub.",english

If the major non-BJP parties unite, then the smaller parties and forces can extend support to them.” Karat, with support of other party influentials, notably Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, had successfully opposed party general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s advocacy for an alliance with Congress to defeat BJP. 

The party ruled out “an understanding or electoral alliance with the Congress party” in its draft political resolution released earlier this year. In an apparent softening of stance, and an acknowledgement that any division of opposition votes only stands to benefit BJP, the party leadership has also emphasised that there is a need to ensure a pooling of anti-BJP votes, state-wise. 

Karat’s editorial also appears to open the doors to a likely realignment of anti-BJP forces in West Bengal and Tripura, where the Left faced a rout at hands of BJP. The CPM leader also said any attempts to forge a non-BJP, non-Congress ‘federal front’, of the kind mooted by Telangana CM K C Rao, was unlikely to succeed. 

“Some of the regional parties like DMK and RJD are with Congress in their respective states. Further, there are many contradictions among the regional parties in terms of policies and regional interests which will prevent all the regional parties coming together,” said Karat, in an indication that CPM may may no longer be enthusiastic about forging a‘ third front”. 

The sentiments for a realignment of political strategy were borne out by Kerala CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who, in a public address, made the same assertions about backing Congress — CPM’s arch rivals in Kerala — wherever the party was in a position to defeat BJP. The Kerala unit had earlier threw its weight behind Karat’s line, tipping the scales against Yechury’s stance for partnership with Congress. The political turnaround which appears to have prompted by party’s debacle in Tripura , comes at a time when opposition forces are seen to be cobbling together a broad understanding over political strategy to defeat BJP.",english

He said the society has always found ways to adapt to changing times even when there have been fears of machines replacing humans. “We have to try and give people the ability to move out of agriculture into industry and services, where income is much higher. We need to figure out ways to do this,” Rajan said here.”What jobs will humans be able to do in 10-15 years that are immune from threat? Jobs that require high intelligence and creativity; jobs that require human empathy and jobs where human working for us bolster our status in some way,” he added. The former RBI Governor in his address outlining the vision for India at #FUTURE Global Digital Summit organised by the Kerala government also expressed fears that Artificial Intelligence would take up jobs – both high skilled and unskilled. He said that the country needs to embrace technology and become a leader in the digital transformation taking place around the globe. Rajan also said that India needs to create good jobs because the job statics are not very good in the country.“We can clearly do well and we should do more, not just for people who are going to enter the labour force, but for the people who are already in it,” he said. The Professor, Finance at University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, said India has fewer jobs to lose. “Many don’t have the cushy jobs, which are threatened. But that is an opportunity. Change is happening and the change will threaten job. We need to make people capable of adapting.” The #future global digital summit, where hundreds of delegates, entrepreneurs, startup founders and CEOs took part in panel discussions, aimed at paving the way for the digital transformation of Kerala, where internet penetration is highest in the country. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan while inaugurating the two-day event on Thursday vowed to embrace digital technology as a means of bridging the gap between the rich and the poor.

The agitators, comprising farmers and local people, alleged that the government proposal would destroy more than 200 acres of paddy field, leaving many people homeless and jobless at Keezhattur village and surrounding area. 
It would also result in the destruction of wetland of the area, they said, adding that their fight is for the protection of environment and livelihood. The agitation has taken a political turn as most of the participants are former CPI(M) workers, who were expelled from the party after taking part in the stir. 
Though the outfit 'Vayalkilikal' had been on a warpath for the past three months, the agitation came into focus after a group of persons, stated to be CPI(M) activists, set fire to a temporary shed of the protesters on March 14. 
It was on the same day that a National Highway Authority of India team had arrived in the area for surveying. In a related development, the house of the 'Vayalkili' leader Suresh Keezhattoor was attacked by a group of unidentified persons on March 22. 
Meanwhile, in a bid to overcome the stalemate over the land acquisition issue, PWD minister G Sudhakaran has written0 to the Centre, seeking the possibility of constructing a flyover in the area. The minister said the state had written to union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari in this regard. 
The issue had also figured in the ongoing session of the state Assembly, where the Congress-led UDF opposition alleged that the CPI(M) government was trying to suppress the agitation of farmers. 
However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had maintained that the government would not backtrack from the land acquisition for development purpose and termed the agitation as ""anti-democratic and anti-development"". The CM had also said that 56 of the total 60 landowners in Keezhattur had already given consent letters for the acquisition.",english

TRIVANDRUM: The anger over Kerala’s move to release a ruling party leader serving life in prison reached the state assembly on Friday.The Communist government decided to release PK Kunjananthan, 69, accused of plotting the 2012 murder of rebel leader TP Chandrasekharan, on health grounds.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan justified the move saying aged prisoners have the right to remission and many had enjoyed this earlier during the Congress rule.“We let out prisoners, whoever they are, only after following the due procedure,” he told the house amidst protests.“There’s no discrimination against or favour towards anybody.” He said there was a proposal to commute the punishment of prisoners aged 70.Governor P Sathasivam, who was the chief justice of India, had last year rejected Vijayan’s proposal to grant remission to some of the lifers.Kunjananthan has been out on parole for 301 days and of that, 217 days after Vijayan assumed office in 2016. He even attends party meetings while on parole.The slain leader’s widow, KK Rema, said the killers deserve no mercy and she would fight the move “legally and politically.” Her statement came after the police approached her seeking her view on the proposal.The court found they finished off Chandrasekharan, 52, as he attracted cadres of Vijayan’s Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM into his breakaway group.A gang of seven waylaid the leader travelling alone on his motorbike at night and brutally killed inflicting 52 wounds and mutilating the body.They threw crude bombs to scare away people before the act, in their characteristic way.Though the CPM denied any role in the killing, it was since providing the killers with all assistance including legal aid.The opposition says they are all having a good time in-and-out of jail after the regime change.One of them got married while on parole, and the local legislator even went to bless the bridegroom who took a parade on a luxury convertible.“The chief minister describes Kunjananthan as ‘my close friend’, and his friend as his boys are enjoying life by all means,” said Congress legislator Sunny Joseph.They staged a walkout after the speaker refused a debate in the assembly on the issue.

Even while saying that the state is going through a huge financial crisis, the LDF government seems to be less concerned about it when it comes to spending money so as to renovate the official residences of its ministers. According to reports, the government has spent a whopping sum of Rs 90 lakh for this purpose. It must be noted that the government has been receiving criticism for the expensive cars and the huge medical reimbursement bills claimed by its ministers. 
Earlier, RTI activist D B Binu had filed an RTI application following which the government has provided the details. According to the report, while Rs 8.48 lakh was spent on curtain works at the official residences of nine ministers, another Rs 82.35 lakh was spent on maintenance works at the residences of all ministers.

The residence of minister Kadakampally Surendran comes next with Rs 12.42 lakh while the lowest amount was spent at the official residences of PWD Minister G Sudhakaran (Rs 33,000) and Education Minister C Raveendranath (Rs 39,351). According to the RTI information, lakhs of rupees were spent at the residences of other ministers such as CM Pinarayi Vijayan K Raju, E Chandrasekharan, J Mercykutty Amma, K T Jaleel, A K Saseendran and V S Sunil Kumar. 
Binu accused that a huge amount of money is being looted by certain groups in the name of maintenance. He said,“There is a mafia operating hand in glove with the contractors, PWD officials and ministers’ staff to siphon off money in the name of maintenance works at the ministers’ residences.” He also demanded that a transparent system must be introduced so as to make sure that public money is spent in the most appropriate way.

RED CORRIDOR OF INDIA WAS CREATED BY THE DEEP STATE 

KACHRAWAAL AND MOMOTO CAME INTO POWER WITH DEEP STATE HELP 




The CIA funded a program called “Operation Gladio,” an effort to build up paramilitary groups around Europe  .. 
The Gladio units were originally organized under the supervision of NATO ( Rothschild’s private army ).  It was a security network inside the security state 
Gladio’s terrorism was conducted in order to shape the minds of the European public, and thus manipulate the political landscape in favor of the goals of U.S. and European white Jew elites. 
In the process of authorizing and conducting false flag bombing attacks, Western kosher elites and institutions intentionally killed, maimed and/or psychologically terrorized thousands of European citizens.  
This violence was carried out with the top-secret collusion of select members of Western European governments, as well as through loyal neocons (controlled by Jews )cadres within their intelligence agencies, judicial branches, and various police services. 
Operation Gladio was of course hidden from the public, since it constitutes both treason as well as murder conducted by the very Western government institutional structures sworn by law to protect their citizenry from such crimes 
Gladio was responsible for bombings, kidnappings and assassinations Operation Gladio was never intended to be publicly acknowledged. It was a multi-national military plan to arm and train clandestine groups in ALL of its member countries and elsewhere in Europe. 
Operating under the aegis of NATO with CIA input/supervision, Operation Gladio utilized false flag terrorism, mainly bombings but also shootings, in service to what it defined as the “strategy of tension.” 
This “strategy” was seen as a way to manipulate European public perception, thought, opinion and voting behavior away from progressive political parties and leadership, and toward the conservative pole of the political spectrum.  
Some Gladio operatives have testified that the intent was to force the public to seek a stronger more authoritarian police and State presence in order to protect citizens.. False flag attacks were routinely carried out by  Operation Gladio. 
They were trained experts in Hegelian dialectic 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2014/10/hegelian-dialectic-cancer-on-this.html 

They worked in tandem with LE CERCLE ..  who is a more potent and secretive part of Bilderberg inner kosher club 

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2011/09/shrewd-club-within-naive-bilderberg.html 





MK ARE THE INITIALS OF MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND ( GANDHI  ) AND MARTIN  ( LUTHER ) KING JR 



http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/09/tavistock-institute-creating-herd.html 

The false reality created by Gladio intentionally portrayed enemises of white Jews  in Europe as “violent murderers of innocent civilians.”     
This narrative was endlessly amplified by Rothschild owned / controlled  media in the U.S. where it meshed rather seamlessly with both the FBI’s COINTELPRO activities and the CIA’s Operation Chaos program on the domestic front.    
COINTELPRO (an acronym for COunter INTELligence PROgram) was a series of covert, and at times illegal, projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic political organizations.  
COINTELPRO tactics are still used to this day, and have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare; smearing individuals and groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media; harassment; wrongful imprisonment; and illegal violence, including assassination. 
Western kosher elites , most of them descendants of Rothschild’s Opium drug running FREEMASON agents, used a great many institutions of State to intentionally target and kill their own citizens for political purposes, and then conspired to hide that fact. 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2010/12/dirty-secrets-of-boston-tea-party-capt.html 
The importance of this reality cannot be overstated.  Failing to widely publicly expose and discuss the history of Operation Gladio has left all citizens of Western nations vulnerable to the continued use of State sponsored false flag terrorism in new and varied manifestations. 
When we examine Operation Gladio from a more macro perspective we must remain cognizant of both past and ongoing U.S. and Western European assaults on Third World governments.  That people of color around the globe have been the targets of Western imperial violence for over 500 years is simple historical reality.   
What Operation Gladio demonstrates decisively is that Western elites saw the cold blooded murder of their own citizens as no more an obstacle to their plans for global control than the murder of countless residents of the many Third World nations which were still struggling to free themselves from Western domination. 
The perceptions, thinking and consciousness of the citizens of Western Europe and the US have been powerfully shaped by the new narratives emanating from events of 9/11, and from subsequent terror attacks.   
Although these events are routinely blamed upon Islamic jihadist groups, knowledgeable observers find that numerous questions remain unanswered regarding the true identity of the perpetrators, often including the nature of their connections to Western intelligence structures. 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2011/10/ethnic-cleansing-of-blackskinned-people.html 
Yet in spite of the historical reality of Gladio never has NATO been subjected to legal action and criminal prosecution for conducting the false flag bombings and murders of civilians in Western Europe 
US wars in Vietnam , Cambodia and Afghanistan have a lot to do with Opium drugs 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/11/pol-pot-of-khmer-rouge-great-cambodian.html 
Unaccountable and unpunished, with its Gladio units still in place, NATO instead offers possible cover for the continuing conduct of false flag terrorism in Europe.   
On the US domestic front the CIA also has never been subjected to legal action and criminal prosecution for its role in advising/coordinating Operation Gladio bombings and terrorism 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2017/05/nato-bombing-of-yugoslavia-in-1999-and.html 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2017/05/nato-bombing-of-yugoslavia-in-1999-and_25.html 
The total impunity enjoyed by NATO, the CIA and all the interconnected Western institutional structures of police, military, politicians and judiciary exists for a very specific reason. 
In the words of convicted Operation Gladio bomber Vincente Vinciguerra, the reason is simple:--   ” . . .  because the state cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what happened.” 
For the State to investigate, prosecute and punish itself for terrorism is of course unimaginable.  To do so would be an admission that Western institutions have in fact been for many decades morally and legally bankrupt, and have been operating to systematically murder their own citizens while engaging in a cover-up.   
Such an admission would validate my contention that the institutions of the West currently lack all moral and legal legitimacy, therefore such an admission cannot occur. 
Today NATO, multiple Western European governments and the government of the U.S. are suspected by increasing numbers of the world’s citizens of continuing to use false flag terrorism in order to validate their ongoing “war on terror.” 
It is Hegelian dialectic which caused EU with seamless  borders and EURO currency. 
Western governments and institutions clearly exist as criminal entities which function outside the rule of all recognized morality and law, domestic and international. Western kosher elites have systematically killed their own citizens and they lied about it. There is a great deal of evidence that they continue to do both while hiding   behind the mask of false flag terrorism 
Many former JEW Nazis made their way into U.S. intelligence services after WWII, given the many decades of politically useful false flag events in the West that have followed. 
Hitler was a JEW and a NASI .   Nasi  is a Hebrew title meaning “Prince of the Sanhedrin"" in Mishnaic Hebrew. 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/10/if-zionist-jews-created-isis-who.html 
The State kills its own citizens and blames a foreign or domestic enemy.  The population looks to the state for protection and surrenders their democratic rights to an ever more militaristic, invasive and repressive State.   
State power increases along with kosher corporate profits in many sectors of the permanent wartime economy of the U.S.  The bewildered populace lives in fear and is psychologically vulnerable to the next false flag terror event which in truth the government, rather than “terrorists,” actually control.  
The history of Operation Gladio, including the failure of Western institutions to publicize and prosecute its murderous activities, unmasks the kosher elites as capable of “doing literally anything” in their quest for power and domination. 
Every shooting in USA or Europe has a strange coincidence – some training drill happens for the same scenario at that very place.. 

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 25, 2018 at 11:32 AM WHY IS MODI AND RUN JAITLEY SUPPORTING BITCOIN... 

WE HAD JAITLEY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS DURING HIS BUDGET SPEECH IN FEB 2018.. 

READ THE 17 PART POST BELOW-- 

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2018/02/blockchain-bitcoin-value-skyrocketed.html 

BITCOIN IS A PROJECT OF KOSHER DEEP STATE OF USA TO FUND THEIR COVERT SPYING OPERATIONS.   THERE ARE NO SECRETS ON THE DARK WEB..   BIG BROTHER KNOWS EVERYTHING. 

DONT EVEN THINK THAT BLOCKCHAIN IS SECURE AND IRREVERSIBLE... BLOCKCHAIN WAS USED BY JEWS IN ISRAEL AN GEORGIA TO LEGITIMIZE GRABBED LAND.. ALL OVER THE PLANET-- DEEP STATE IS 100% KOSHER. 
BILDERBERG IS RUN BY THE INNER KOSHER CLUB .. 

NOW THAT PEOPLE WATCH WHO ATTENDS BILDERBERG MEETINGS AND THE LID OF THE PANDORAs BOX IS BLOWN -- LE CERCLE IS USED TO GREATER POTENCY AND SECRETIVE EFFECT. 

Bitcoin isn’t the decentralized, crowdsourced alternative to fiat currency that many people think it is. To the contrary, it’s a “privatized” technology just like the internet, GPS systems, and the TOR browser. 

Natalya Kaspersky, president of the “InfoWatch” group of companies and co-founder and ex-CEO of antivirus security software company “Kaspersky Lab says ""--     Bitcoin is dollar 2.0-- Its rate is controlled by the owners of exchange"" 

Satoshi Nakamoto, the individual credited with creating Bitcoin, is not actually a person, but rather a “code name”  

Smartphone APPS are known data-mining tools that spy on users. 

WE KNOW HOW MANY YEARS CHINESE HUAWEI STAYED IN A POSH 5 STAR HOTEL IN BANGALORE--OPERATING FROM THERE ..   


WE ASK AJIT DOVAL TO INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THE UPA MINISTER WHO ALLOWED HUAWEI UNLIMITED PRIVELAGES. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is a Chinese multinational networking, telecommunications equipment, and services company -- the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world 

In 2015, German cybersecurity company G Data reported that it had found that malware that can listen to calls, track users, and make online purchases was found pre-installed on smartphones from Chinese companies including Lenovo, Xiaomi, and Huawei. 

On February 14, 2018, in testimony to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the heads of six major US intelligence agencies said they would not recommend the use of products and services from Chinese tech giants Huawei by Americans. 

The Australian government recently announced that they will no longer be using phones from Chinese phone manufacturers Huawei , which has been accused of allowing the Chinese government to conduct espionage though their products. The Australian Department of Defense announced that they have stopped using Huawei phones.. 

WE WANT AJIT DOVAL TO INVESTIGATE AND DECLARE FOR RECORD HOW MANY YEARS HUAWEI STAYED IN A 5 STAR HOTEL IN BANGALORE.. IS THIS NORMAL? 

Best Buy Co Inc, the largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer, decided to cut ties with Huawei 

Personal data from about 50 million Facebook users were used by a data analytics firm working Cambridge Analytica. Don't use Facebook on your phone.  

Facebook first learned of breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hadn't mentioned it publicly until Friday ( two days ago ) 

I HAD POSTED THAT FACEBOOKS IS SNOOPING AND CENSORING-- ADDING THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG IS A CRIMINAL WHO MUST BE ARRESTED THE DAY HE COMES TO INDIA.. HE ALSO STOLE DIVYA NARENDRAs CEREBRAL RIGHTS. 

DEEP STATE SPIES AND CENSORS DATA .. 

THE POST BELOW IS JUST 5% COMPLETE.. THIS SHOULD BE PART OF THE TRAINING CURRICULUM FOR RAW OFFICERS... THIS IS NO LONGER IN THE REALM OF CONSPIRACY THEORY CRACKPOTS.

THIS PATHETIC GUJARATI FELLOW CANNOT GIVE A SINGLE SPEECH WITHOUT REFERRING TO GANDHI AND BR AMBEDKAR--

BOTH JEW ROTHSCHILDs DEEP STATE AGENTS 


The ""cryptocracy,"" or shadow government is real.  
A few JEWS controlled the whole planet before WW2.    They controlled the Pandavas , the Kauravas and the neutral party.    They controlled the North Pole , the South Pole and the equator. 
TODAY NOBODY ON THIS PLANET BELIEVES  THAT HITLER COMMITTED SUICIDE IN A BERLIN BUNKER .. THANKS TO THE INTERNET AND FEW BLOGGERS WITH BALLS 




In USA and EU ,  real and actual political power does not reside with democratically elected public representatives, but with an elite set of KOSHER individuals who exercise power behind the scenes.  
This secret government is not responsible to democratic institutions., official governments are subservient to it.  

PATHETIC-- NAY CHOOTIYA , INDIAN COMMIES DONT EVEN KNOW THAT MARX/ LENIN/ STALIN/ ENGELS WERE ALL ROTHSCHILDs AGENTS AND JEWS

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 25, 2018 at 7:18 PM CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL WAS THE ONLY SOUL ON THE PLANET WHO RECKONED THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WIN AGAINST RoTHSCHIILDs CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON.. 

I PENNED A 11 PART SERIES ON THE US ELECTIONS. I WARNED TRUMP—THAT UNLESS HE DECLARES THAT HE WILL INVOKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT, THE DEEP STATE WILL SINK HIM. 
TRUMP DID SO.. 

REST IS HISTORY… 

MIND YOU, I WAS AGAINST GUNS IN USA.. VEHEMENTLY.. 

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2012/08/no-mensa-material-in-american-nra-capt.html 

SEE CONTEXT IS PARAMOUNT… 

NOW— 

LEAVE ALONE GETTING TRUMP IMPEACHED.. 

THE DEEP STATE IS NOW WORRIED THAT TRUMP WONT STEP DOWN AT THE END OF HIS TENURE—TILL HE DRAINS THE SWAMP… 
SO—SO SO 

YOU CAN EXPECT THE NEOCONS LEAD BY HILLARY CLINTON, OBAMA , VAN JONES AND ROTHSCHILDs MEDIA , TO RAMP UP THE PRESSURE –FOR GUN CONTROL .. 


LET ME QUOTE : 

HILLARY COULD NEVER MUSTER 9 % OF CROWDS ATTRACTED BY TRUMP IN HIS RALLY SPEECHES -- TILL SHE STOLE AN ADVISE GIVEN BY THIS BLOGSITE TO TRUMP-- ""INTRODUCE A ROCK CONCERT ELEMENT "".. 

MUSIC FOR NOT SO BRIGHT HILLY BILLY YANKS HAS ATTRACTED HUGE CROWDS FOR HILLARY IN THE LAST WEEK OF HER CAMPAIGN---  

TRUMP IGNORED MY ADVISE ON ROCK MUSIC … 

TRUMP ALSO IGNORED MY ADVISE OF CALLING IT A PEOPLE MOVEMENT TSUNAMI , CLEANSING THE AEGEAN STABLES OF WHITE HOUSE -- INSTEAD OF A TEPID ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"".. 

CROOKED HILLARY IS NOW SUPER CONFIDENT OF WINNING BY RIGGING THE ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES --.. 

IF THIS HILLARY VICTORY HAPPENS ""AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM"" WILL KICK IN BY THE SECOND AMENDMENT… 

IT BE LIKE A MILLION SHIP CAPTAINS HOLLERING ----.. 

"" ALL HANDS ON DECK "" .. 

""EMERGENCY STATIONS NOW ""… 

WE ARE 100% SURE -- THE D O J CONTROLLED BY BIG BROTHER , IS INSTIGATING ALL THIS.

YESTERDAY I HEARD THE ""POTHOLE JOURNALIST "" FAYE DSOUZA OF MIRROR NOW TV , ANNOUNCING IN A GRANDIOSE MANNER --THAT NO POLICE CAN TOUCH A FEMALE JOURNALIST... 

THIS PEA BRAINED WOMAN FAYE DSOUZA BELONGS TO JAIL-- SHE HAS BEEN TRANSGRESSING LIMITS OF RESPONSIBLE JOURNALISM AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY... 

HOW DID RAJIV GANDHI GET BLOWN UP? 

BY A TAMIL WOMAN TANMOZHI RAJARATNAM PRETENDING TO BE A JOURNALIST- AS A PARTNER OF LTTE OPERATIVE ""ONE EYED JACK"" SIVARASAN . 

NAXAL WOMEN ARE TRAINED TO SHOVE STICKS AND STONES INTO THEIR ANUS AND VAGINAS AND CRY RAPE... IT IS A PART OF THEIR MODUS OPERANDI.. 

DURING THE THICK OF KERALA NAXALISM , THE BIGGEST ASSASSINS WERE TWO FEMALES MANDAKINI ( WIFE OF NAXAL KUNNIKKAL NARAYANAN ) AND THEIR DAUGHTER AJITHA -- A 17 YEAR OLD GIRL WEARING JEANS --A NOVELTY IN KERALA THOSE DAYS. 

HOW DID KACHRAWAAL GRAB POWER IN DELHI WITH THE HELP OF THE ""DEEP STATE"" ? .. 

BY ""FALSE FLAG ATTACKS "" ON SIX DELHI CHURCHES AND GETTING RETIRED USEFUL IDIOTS LIKE TOP COP JULIO RIBEIRO TO MOUTH NONSENSE ON TV AND MEDIA PRINT ..

IT IS EASY TO POINT FINGERS AND QUOTE IPC SECTIONS FOR THE PEA BRAINED TV ANCHORS OF BENAMI MEDIA.. 

I HAD PREDICTED TO MY WIFE-- WHEN DELHI POLICE MEETS JNU STUDENTS MARCHING TOWARDS PARLIAMENT HOUSE ( ATTENDANCE ISSUE -- SEXUAL MOLESTATION OF 9 FEMALE JNU COMMIE STUDENTS ), SOME NAXAL FEMALE JOURNALIST WILL BE AT THE THICK OF ACTION TO PROVOKE THE DELHI POLICE.. 

THIS IS EXACTY WHAT HAPPENED.. 

IT IS THE JOB OF THE DGP OF DELHI POLICE TO INSTRUCT HIS UNIFORMED MEN , NOT TO ALLOW JOURNALISTS TO AFFECT THEIR OPERATIONS..  

I HAVE TOLD THIS BEFORE SEVERAL TIMES-- YET IN KASHMIR TERRORISTS IN THE GARB OF JOURNALISTS KEEP TAKING VIDEOS OF POLICE AND ARMY DOING THEIR JOB-- BASICALLY CHERRY PICKING .. TO SHOW OUR UNIFORMED MEN IN BAD LIGHT.... 

BUT THE DGP OF DELHI POLICE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO TELL HIS POLICE TO TAKE THEIR OWN VIDEOS -- HOW JNU COMMIE STUDENTS ARE ATTACKING POLICE AND PROVOKING THEM.. NOWHERE ON THE PLANET IS POLICE ABUSED THE WAY IT HAPPENS IN INDIA--WITH COLLEGIUM JUDICIARY VEHEMENTLY AGAINST THE POLICE.. CRUSHING THEIR MORALE.. 
I HAVE SEEN THIS PLANET FOR 4 DECADES.. 


TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY THE WHOLE OF INDIA SAW TOP DELHI POLICE PLEADING WITH AGGRESSIVE JOURNALISTS-- LIVE..  WE ASK THAT OUR UNIFORMED MEN ARE TRAINED IN ""FALSE FLAG ATTACKS "" AND ""HEGELIAN DIALECTIC"" AS PART OF THEIR TRAINING COURSE MATERIAL..

IF INDIA HAS TO NIP OUT PAKISTAN AIDED TERRORISM IN KASHMIR , ARTICLE 370 AND 35A MUST GO.. 

WE DO NOT NEED TO RUN TO ANY COLLEGIUM JUDGE… 

WE DO NOT CARE FOR THESE UNCONSTITUTIONAL COLLEGIUM JUDGES.. 

Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. 

The article is drafted in Part XXI of the Constitution: Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions. 

The State's Constituent Assembly was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution to be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. 

After the state Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending abrogation, the Article 370 was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution. 

THE ELECTIONS TO THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ASSEMBLY IN 1951 WERE RIGGED. 

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/01/the-kashmir-conflict-capt-ajit-vadakayil.html 

They exploited Article 370, and adopted Sections 6, 8 and 9 for incorporation in the Constitution under which the State was to be governed in the future. 

Article 370 gave the solitary State of Jammu & Kashmir the right to have a separate Constitution and separate flag, but nowhere does it say which category of Indians will enjoy all citizenship rights in Jammu & Kashmir and which sections will not. 

PARAMOUNT CLAUSE: "" ETHNIC CLEANSING "" - OF SIX LAKHS KASHMIRI PANDITS BY KASHMIRI MUSLIMS SUPPORTED BY PAKISTAN, MAKES ARTICLE 370 NULL AND VOID… 

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/09/uniform-civil-code-in-india-capt-ajit.html 

Jawaharlal Nehru, the HALF BROTHER of Sheikh Abdullah (who married the wife of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-- JEWESS BEGUM AKBAR JEHAN) subverted the basic structure of the Indian Constitution in May 1954 to deprive all Indian citizens, including refugees from West Pakistan settled in Jammu province. of their fundamental right to exercise all rights in Jammu & Kashmir… 

Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah made sure that the Permanent Residents of Jammu & Kashmir shall exercise all rights all over India… 

Nehru amended Article 368 without taking the Indian Parliament into confidence, THOUGH Parliament alone had the power to amend or not amend the Constitution, to amend Article 35 and add to it the atrocious Article 35A which was enforced in Jammu & Kashmir through the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, May 1954. 

Article 35A enabled the Jammu & Kashmir Constituent Assembly to deny citizenship rights to the HINDU refugees from West Pakistan and all other Indians, barring Permanent Residents of the State. 

Armed with absolute power, the Jammu & Kashmir Constituent Assembly adopted Section 6 which said no persons who had crossed over to the state after May 1944 will be considered eligible for citizenship rights. 

Nehru enforced Article 35A in Jammu & Kashmir UNCONSTITUTIONALLY - More important he criminally CONCEALED it. 


He hid the amendments from the public, by not mentioning the same in the main body of the Constitution—read this line twice. 


The unconstitutional amendments to Article 368 and Article 35 were mentioned only in Appendix-I and Appendix-II, respectively, so that they could escape public attention in a CRIMINAL MANNER. 


AN APPENDIX CAN NEVER HIJACK THE MAIN BODY OF ANY ARTICLE. ANY IDIOT KNOWS THIS UNLESS HE IS SENILE. 

CONTINUED TO 2-- 



Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 2:57 PM CONTINUED FROM 1- 

Nehru in cahoots with his HALF BROTHER Sheikh Abdullah conspired against the HINDU refugees from West Pakistan, and then further hatched a conspiracy against all Indian citizens, in order to pander to communalists in Kashmir, by subverting Articles 16 and 19 of the Indian Constitution which deal with the rights of Indian citizens, including fundamental rights. 

Article 19, for example, says that “All citizens shall have the right (a) to freedom of speech and expression, (b) to assemble peacefully and without arms, (c) to form associations or unions, (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India, (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business”. 

It follows that what is needed is not just the abrogation of Article 370 but also the revocation of Article 35A. This is the only course left to enable the refugees from West Pakistan and other Indians to exercise citizenship rights in Jammu & Kashmir and integrate it fully into India. 

In October 2015, the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir has ruled that the Article 370 cannot be ""abrogated, repealed or even amended."" 

It explained that the clause (3) of the Article conferred power to the State's Constituent Assembly to recommend to the President on the matter of the repeal of the Article. 

Since the Constituent Assembly did not make such a recommendation before its dissolution in 1957, the Article 370 has taken on the features of a ""permanent provision"" despite being titled a temporary provision in the Constitution. 

BALLS ! 

WHAT IS DONE BY DECEIT IS "" NULL AND VOID "".. Article 35A came into existence by a Presidential Order passed by Dr. Rajandra Prasad ( Rothschild sponsored FAKE Kayastha ) on the advice of Nehru’s cabinet in 1954... 


President of India has sole legislative power under article 123 power to make ordinance when either house of the Parliament is not in session.  


- This legislative powers of the President has an EXPIRY SHELL PERIOD OF MERE SIX MONTHS.... 

The Constitution can be amended only by the Parliament as per procedure clearly laid out in Article 368. but Article 35A was never presented before the Parliament of India… 

This effectively means, in this case, the President bypassed the amending procedure as laid out in the Constitution of India in order to add the new Article 35A… 

This also means that Article 368 of the Constitution, in its application to Jammu and Kashmir, also got amended!.. 

The President of India does not have legislative power, but here in this case he performed the function of Parliament!.. 

Article 35A appears in the Constitution as an appendix…How can an Article, which has been implemented on the ground as if it’s a part of the Constitution, be missing from the text of the Constitution ? 


Article 35A was an amendment in our Constitution via the back door (Presidential order), without the involvement of India’s Parliament… 


Article 35A is an example of the abuse of Article 370.   Article 35A is a violation of the basic structure of our Constitution.    Article 35A spawned a set of laws that were discriminatory in nature. .. 

It curbs certain basic rights enshrined in the very Preamble of the Constitution. A Kashmiri woman marrying a non-permanent resident or outsider loses all succession rights, while a Kashmiri man does not. 

As a result of the implementation of Article 35A,.lakhs of Indian HINDU citizens have been deprived of “ JUSTICE, social, economic and political ” and “ EQUALITY of status and of opportunity ”... 

In the laws under Article 370 read with Article 35A even the President of India may be denied a place or land for official purpose. This is a breach of trust… 

CONTINUED TO 4-- 


Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 2:58 PM CONTINUED FROM 2--

Democratic India cannot allow any section of its population to be treated as second-rate citizens in any part of the country.

Article 368 is the only way to amend the Constitution,.. Not the President.

The marginal note of Article 368 states; “ Power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and procedure, therefore ”.. Which means it is the Parliament that has the power to amend the Constitution.

Sub-clause 2 of the Article 368 states that: --
“ An amendment of this Constitution may be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament, and when the Bill is passed in each House by majority of not less than two-third of the members of that House present and voting, [it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon] the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of Bill...""

The President of India does NOT have the sole UNBRIDLED power to amend the constitution through the bypass of the entire Constitutional mechanism nor does Article 370 give power to the President to insert any Article in any Part of the Constitution....

The parliamentary route of lawmaking was bypassed when the President incorporated Article 35A into the Constitution. Article 368 (i) of the Constitution empowers only Parliament to amend the Constitution. The President acted outside his jurisdiction.. Article 35A is void because the Nehru government did not place it before Parliament for discussion..

Article 370 grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A empowers the state legislature to define permanent citizens.

Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian Constitution are an ""unnecessary baggage"" of the past and hence these laws be repealed..

Restricting citizens from other States from getting employment or buying property within Jammu and Kashmir is a violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution…

Article 370 (along with Article 35A) is an anachronistic decree that has outlived its utility, militates against India’s sovereignty, and discriminates against both Indians and Kashmiris by mutually excluding each other from syncretic growth. It is redundant, and constitutionally discarded into the dustbin of history.

THE TERM "" SUBJUDIDE "" DOES NOT APPLY TO INDIA.. AS WE DON’T HAVE A JURY SYSTEM..

Below: The DEEP STATE members attend the Bohemian Club ritual 


Bohemian Grove is a 2,700-acre campground located at 20601 Bohemian Avenue, in Monte Rio, California where the DEEP STE members conduct rituals every mid-July. 
The TV producers of HOUSE OF CARDS dared to show the mascot – a giant 30 foot high  THOTH ( mix of Garuda and Lord Shani carrier raven ) —and they shut the serial down.   
Other than the elite deep state members ( Rothschild’s agents ) you can see blacks with HUGE DONGS for anal sex humping and boyish pansy males for ANAL SEX receiving. 

The main encampment area consists of 160 acres of old-growth redwood trees over 1,000 years old, with some trees exceeding 300 feet  in height—this is the RED WOOD tress Bill Clinton is referring to. 
On July 15, 2000, filmmaker Alex Jones and his cameraman, Mike Hanson, infiltrated the Bohemian Grove to uncover the giant THOTH statue being worshipped , with human sacrifices thrown into its fiery interior. 

With a hidden camera, Jones and Hanson filmed the Cremation of Care ceremony. 

President Richard Nixon talks about the Bohemian Grove ""The Bohemian Grove -- which I attend, from time to time -- it the most faggy  Goddamn  thing you could ever imagine “ 
FAG is slang for gay male 

Below: The DEEP STATE shut down the HOUE OF CARDS TV serial for depicting this ritual

SNUFF VIDEOS ARE ABOUT KILLING THE SEXUAL PARTNER WHILE THEY HAVE ORGASM. 
In the HOUSE OF CARDS the female US President Claire Underwood ( depicted after Hillary Clinton’s character  ) is shown killing her sex partner while she rides him to orgasm on the floor.    
She and her husband Frank Underwood ( when he was President ) were fucked as a  sandwich by their body guard .. 
While the Presidential ball is going on President Frank Underwood is getting anally fucked in the basement 
All this is nothing.. The real white house is a DEN of crimes. This building consumes maximum cocaine on the planet..

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION WAS CONDUCTED BY JEW ROTHSCHILDs FREEMASON LODGES IN CAHOOTS WITH ROTHSCHILD MONOPOLISED MEDIA 
THEY CREATED THE LIE “ THE QUEEN SAID IF PEOPLE DON’T HAVE BREAD, THEY MUST EAT CAKE”. 
THE QUEEN NEVER SAID THAT –SHE WAS A GOOD WOMAN 
ROTHSCHILDs AGENTS THEN EXECUTED THE QUEEN AND KING WITH BRIBED AGENTS SCREAMING “ LIBERTY , EQUALITY, FRATERNITY “ –  THE CRY OF COMMIE JNU PROFESSORS.     

 SINCE THIS INCIDENT ( LIKE TURKEY ) JEWS CONTROL FRANCE..    EVERY FRENCH PRESIDENT IS A CRYPTO JEW

THE SAME WAY , THE DEEP STATE IN RUSSIA , MURDERED THE CZAR AND HIS LOVELY FAMILY—AND KICK STARTED COMMUNISM.. 
JEW ROTHSCHILDs AGENTS AND THE MONOPOLISED MEDIA TOLD LIES “THE QUEEN IS FUCKING A MONK WITH A HUGE DONG NAMED RASPUTIN ( SIC ), WHO IS INTERFERING IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS” 


IN REALITY RASPUTIN WAS A HEALER WHO HEALED THE CZARs ONLY SON—THE NEXT CZAR OF A DEADLY INCURABLE DISEASE.

Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as ""surveillance companies.""   Their rebranding as ""social media"" by the  DEEP STATE is a most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense. 

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 11:32 PM SOMEONE ASKED ME--

WHY DO YOU SAY THE DEEP STATE APPOINTS I&B MINISTERS IN MOST NATIONS..

OK CHECK THIS OUT ?

EVER HEARD OF PRISM ?

PRISM is a tool used by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to collect private electronic data belonging to users of major internet services like Facebook

National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the US Director of National Intelligence. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine.

PRISM began in 2007..

Its existence was leaked six years later by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as ""dangerous"" and ""criminal"" activities""

NSA has ""direct access"" to the servers of Google, Facebook, and others

PRISM’s existence was leaked by Edward Snowden before he entered into ongoing asylum in Moscow. Microsoft was the first company to join the PRISM program.

The then Minister of External Affairs Salman Khurshid ( of a particular DNA same as ex-President Zakir Hussain ) defended the PRISM program saying, ""This is not scrutiny and access to actual messages"". It is only computer analysis of patterns of calls and emails that are being sent. It is not actually snooping specifically on content of anybody's message or conversation. Some of the information they got out of their scrutiny, they were able to use it to prevent serious terrorist attacks in several countries.""

Khurshid baby's comments contradicted his Foreign Ministry's characterization of violations of privacy as ""unacceptable.""

We know why Modi chose some of his I&B ministers- my lips are sealed as of now.

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 28, 2018 at 5:44 PM THIS IS OLD HAT !

LIKE HOW INDAN COOLIES WERE SHIPPED ABROAD AS SLAVES BY DELIBERATE FAMINE – ROTHSCHILD EXPORTED IRISH TO NORTH AMERICA BY INTRODUCING THE POTATO BLIGHT AND DELIBERATE FAMINE

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2010/04/indentured-coolie-slavery-reinvented.html 

Irish Potato blight was caused by Fungus Phytophthora infestans imported by Rothschild from America

THE ROTTEN POTATOES WHERE SHIPPED TO BELGIUM AND TRIED IN EUROPEAN AIR CONDITIONS AND THEN THIS BLIGHT EXPORTED TO IRELAND. ( 'Phytophthora Infestans' – an air carried fungus.)

Proud to be Hindu April 2, 2018 at 8:30 AM ISKON is trying to turn Sanatan Dharma into one God one religion.

Believe in only one God,God Krishna or u will not get Moksha. 


Capt. Ajit Vadakayil April 2, 2018 at 9:35 AM ISKON IS A BHAKTI MOVEMENT OF SRILA PRABHUPADA

IT IS NOW HIJACKED BY WHITE MEN

IN THEIR DISCOURSES -- THERE IS MORE PROMINENCE TO A FELLOW NAMED CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU --WHO NEVER EXISTED

CHAITANYA BABY IS INSPIRED BY RADHA --WHO NEVER EXISTED

ROTHSCHILD SELECTED MAYAPUR TO SPREAD CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU FUNDA --FOR POLITICAL REASONS-- HE HAD HIS OPIUM FACTORY HERE

ROTHSCHILDs AGENT -- A FELLOW NAMED BHAKTIVINODA THAKUR WAS USED TO SPREAD FAKE GAUDIYA RADHA STUFF AND MADHAVACHARYA WHO NEVER EXISTED.

THE FAKE UDIPI MUTT DOES PROPAGANDA FOR MADHAVACHARYA -- WE NEVER HEARD OF MADHAVACHARYA OR CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU TILL THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA.

THE BULLSHIT ""HARE KRISHNA HARE RAMA MANTRA"" HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SRI RAM

THIS RAM IS INCLUDED TO FOOL HINDUS

IT IS ABOUT RADHA RAMANA

RAMANA MEANS LOVER -- YOU SEE RADHA WAS A LOVER OF KRISHNA--HIS MISTRESS WHO NEVER EXISTED IN ANY PURANA ..

Telugu man Gopala Bhatta Goswami is a FAKE and backdated creation-- the disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. You see Chaitanya baby revealed to Goswami baby that he is an avatar of Krishna ( BALLS !)

Goswami baby created the Radha Raman Temple--which was actually an old Vishnu temple retro installed -- with a shaligram deity of Krishna alongside Radharani.

I WANT MY READERS TO SPREAD THE TRUTH

HARE RAMA OF THE CHANT BY ISKON -- HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SRI RAM.

CHANTING THIS BULLSHIT MANTRA OF HARE RAMA ( RADHA ) HARE KRISHA DOES YOU NO GOOD

Radha-vallabha is another fake sect--where Krishna is called the consort of Radha. Here Radha is the deity-- Krishna is just a side-kick

Shri Radhavallabhlal temple at Vrindavan was a Vishnu temple converted to Radha and Krishna idol - a 2 in 1 .

IN SANKHYA JEW ROTHSCHILD HAS USED HIS AGENTS LIKE PRABHUPADA TO SUBSTITUTE SHIVA / SHAKTI WITH KRISHNA ( A MERE AVATAR OF VISHNU ) AND A FAKE MISTRESS RADHA .

POISON INJECTED VERSES BELOW--

radha purna-sakti, krsna purna-saktiman
dui vastu bheda nai, sastra-paramana
mrgamada, tara gandha yaiche aviccheda
agni, jvalate yaiche kabhu nahi bheda
radha-krsna aiche sada eka-i svarupa
lila-rasa asvadite dhare dui-rupa

Sri Radha is the full energy, and Lord Krsna is the possessor of full power.

The two are not different, as evidenced by the revealed scriptures. They are indeed the same, just as musk and its scent are inseparable, or as fire and its heat are nondifferent. Thus Radha and Lord Krsna are one, yet They have taken two forms to enjoy the mellows of pastimes. (Cc. Adi 4.96-98)

isvarera sakti haya e-tina prakara
eka laksmi-gana, pure mahisi-gana ara
vraje gopi-gana ara sabhate pradhana
vrajendra-nandana ya'te svayam bhagavan

The energies (consorts) of the Supreme Lord are of three kinds: the Laksmis in Vaikuntha, the queens in Dvaraka, and the gopis in Vrndavana. The gopis are the best of all, for they have the privilege of serving Sri Krsna, the primeval Lord, the son of the King of Vraja (Cc. Adi 1.79,80)

SORRY -- All this bull about Radha being a mistress of Lord Krishna and all his thousands of Gopikas whom he flirted with , are all poisons injected into Hinduism by the white Christian invader. Kalidas who invented Radha never existed. Krishna did NOT have 16000 virgin gopikas in vrindavan rather 16000 are dhatus of shasrara chakra . SAHASRARA CHAKRA is a 1000 petalled lotus -- each with 16 kalas or aspects --this works out to 16000 .

this is NOT some girl who has sex with Lord Krishna --taking turns to HUMP.

Narakasura kidnapped 16000 damsels --and Lord Krishna saved these damsels in distress. this is just an allegory.

CONTINUED TO 2- 
Capt. Ajit Vadakayil April 2, 2018 at 9:36 AM CONTINUED FROM 1-

Bhagavata Purana 10.59.42-- is poison injected :--

atho muhUrta ekasmin
nAnAgAreSu tAH striyaH
yathopayeme bhagavAn
tAvad-rUpa-dharo 'vyayaH

“ Then the imperishable Bhagavan [ Sri Krishna], assuming a separate form for each bride, duly married all the princesses simultaneously, each in her own palace.”

This alludes to 16,000 virgins ( gopikas ). 16000 gopikas never existed-- for it is an allegory.

PRABHUPADA WENT AROUND LYING THAT CHAITANYA WAS A AVATAR OF VISHNU

Jew Rothschild inserted a POISON INJECTED chapter Chaitanya Upanishad --in the Atharvaveda

Today Gaudiya Vaishnavas, revere Chaitanya baby as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha.

FAKE Chaitanya Mahaprabhu kept singing the praises of Radha.

EVERY DESH DROHI LITERARY FEST --HAD ATHEIST COMMIES SINGING PRAISES OF KRISHNAs MISTRESS RADHA.

KRISHNA IS JUST AN AVATAR OF VISHNU-- LIKE SRI RAM AND AYYAPPA.

JAYADEVA WHO INVENTED RADHA NEVER EXISTED. HE WAS A FAKE AND BACKDATED CREATION OF JEW ROTHSCHILD.

odissi dance is full of RADHA nonsense. Jayadeva's ashtapadis that are sung in dance performances of Odissi. Oriya bhajans are all ragas and talas specified by Jayadeva's hymns.

THE FAKE MUTTS OF ROTHSCHILD SPREAD THE FAKE WORK OF JAYADEVA ""GITA GOVINDA "" IN TAMIL NADU AND ANDHRA.

In April 16, 2007 Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC III) mentioned Jayadeva as the court poet of king Lakshmanasena of Bengal. And all Oriya Puri party got pissed off.

The Italian waitress release stamps of the FAKE jayadeva in 2009. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik unveiled the stamps at a special function in Jayadev Bhawan

BONGS claim Jayadeva as their own and hold BAUL festival at Kendubilva , west bengal.

Like how Jayadeva found Radha Madhava idols in a river, same way the FAKE madhavacharya of Udipi found a idol of krishna in the sea.

The Mahabharata or ancient Puranas mention Krishna , but NEVER EVER a woman named Radha.

During British Rule all Krishna temples idols were roved to insert Radha as a jodi.

The FAKE Geeta-Govinda was full of immoral sex and erotica to describe the ILLICIT love between ""Radha"" and a married Krishna.

Foul and explicit SEXUAL passages were deleted by Jew Rothschild when original Hindu Mutts protested .

EVEN TODAY DELETED BENGALI VERSES ARE SUNG --

SHOKALE UTTIYO KANU--DOH HAATHE DHARIYO NUNU--THAKAYILE RADHAR GUDHE

( Krishna worke up at dawn , he lifted his heavy prick with both hands--and showed it into Radha's cunt )

WORSE SONGS WERE SUNG EVEN LAST YEAR AT KODUNGALLUR TEMPLE IN KERALA

KODUNGALLUR AMMAYE PANNANAM ENGIL KODIMARAM POLEY ORU KUNNA VENAM

if you want to satisfy Devi ( wife of Shiva ) you need a prick as large as a temple flagpole.

ALL THIS BLASPHEMY HAD BEEN TOLD TO PM MODI AT LEAST 50 TIMES-- PATHETIC FELLOW MODI IS MORE INVOLVED IN GIVING US HAJAAAR JAANKARI ABOUT GANDHI AND BR AMBEDKAR ..

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/03/kodungallur-bharani-festival-capt-ajit.html 

The FAKE Geeta Govinda still contains ABRIDGED verses like the one below--

प्रथम समागम लज्जितया, पटु चाटु शतै: अनुकूलम् .
मृदु मधुर स्मित भाषितया, शिथिली कृत जघन दुकूलम्

""On my first meeting I was bashful, but he spoke hundreds of reassuring words, and while I was speaking softly, sweetly, my silken dress slipped off my hips making me nude ... now why don't you make him to take delight in me, when my heart and mind are filled with love for him...

""I, with my vine-like curvacious and delicate body lay on bed of tender grasss, relaxing delightedly because of sexual union he too was weakened, and his lotus like eyes were half-closed, though while laying on lawn, there again arose passion in him for me... such as we were, now why don't you make him to take delight in me, when my heart and mind are filled with love for him 

AT EVERY DESH DROHI LITERARY FEST THE WHITE MAN CAME AND RECITED SEXUALLY LOADED JAYADEVA VERSES OF GEETA GOVINDA  

NOBODY HEARD OF JAYADEVA ( BORN 1170 AD ) TILL THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA..

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 31, 2018 at 6:33 AM WHEN INDIA BECOMES THIS PLANETs NO 1 SUPER POWER IN 2033 WE WILL BRING WESTERN WAR CRIMINALS ( YEMEN GENOCIDE ) TO JUSTICE..

2.2 LAKH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STARVED TO DEATH-- JUST CEAUSE THEY HAVE ADOPTED ISLAMIC FAITH

ALL THE CRYPTO JEW MULLAHS ARE SILENT

WE ASK--WHY IS ZAKIR NAIL SILENT? IS HE THE SLAVE OF THE JEWISH AL SAUD RULING CLAN OF SAUDI ARABIA ?

BOTH UN AND WHO HAS IGNORED THE CHOLERA / DIPHTHERIA EPIDEMIC SPREADING LIKE WILD FIRE IN YEMEN..

MODI WHO LOVES TO HUG WHITE JEWS HAS SNUFFED OUT BHARATMATAs MORAL VOICE ON THIS PLANET..

The Saudi-led coalition’s bombardment and blockade of the country, with the full support of the US , UK, EU and NATO has destroyed over 71 % of Yemen's healthcare infrastructure.. Will they ever d this to a Jewish or Christian nation ?

Almost the entire nation is cut off from clean water when the Saudi-led coalition blocked all fuel imports forcing pumping stations to close.

And since the death of former MUSLIM President Ali Abdullah Saleh on 4th December 2017, the air campaign has been stepped up, with massacres occurring on a near-daily basis.

The current president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who took office on 27 February 2012 is a CRYPTO JEW . He was placed on the throne by white JEWS . He was the only candidate in the 2012 election..

President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed by JEWS and not by Islamic Houthi snipers.

Before --on 3 June 2011, Saleh was injured in a KOSHER bomb attack on his presidential compound..The explosion killed four bodyguards and injured the prime minister, deputy prime ministers, head of the Parliament, governor of Sanaa and many more..

Saleh suffered a collapsed lung and burns on about 43 percent of his body.

LIKE GADDAFI , SALEH WAS GIVEN A BAD NAME.. GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME AND KILL IT

According to the BILDERBERG CONTROLLED UN Sanctions Panel by 2012 Saleh has amassed fortune worth in excess of 60 billion USD making him one of the richest people in the world. This is a terrific LIE.

62.000 Yemeni children have died in 2017 alone as a result of disease and starvation.

THE BENAMI INDIA MEDIA IS GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES--BY NOT REPORTING ON YEMEN AT ALL. THE SAME MEDIA WAS GIVING US DOLLOPS ON WHY HILLARY CLINTON , THE MOST EVIL WOMAN IN USA SHOULD BE POTUS.

WE KNOW THE CRYPTO JEW WHITE RULERS WHO KEEP SELLING BOMBS AND MISSILES TO KOSHER AL SAUD BLOODLINE RULED SAUDI ARABIA..

The free denizens of this planet SPIT on this foul kosher propaganda of “Iran is behind it” ..

Hundreds of white journalists is still writing that Saudi Arabia launched a war to restore democracy in Yeman --what a travesty of Justice and Truth ! The bullshit articles never fail to mention that Yemen is emerging from decades of dictatorship under Ali Abdullah Saleh.

They said the same for HERO Gaddafi who deposed JEWISH King Idris.

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2011/10/ethnic-cleansing-of-blackskinned-people.html 

A FARCE election in which JEW Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi ran as the only candidate. You see , he is the legitimate president to be restored, but the KOSHER white media never mention that he had been vice-dictator for 20 years. One election with no other candidates and voila, you get all the stamps you need from the immoral western press..

CHOLERA WAS EXTERMINATED ON THIS PLANET... AT SEA WE SAILORS STOPPED TAKING CHOLERA SHOTS.. THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN YEMEN IS GERM WAR FARE TO KILL YEMENI MUSLIMS..

CONTINUED TO 2- 



Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 31, 2018 at 6:34 AM CONTINUES FROM 1-

THE BASTARD COMMIES OF JNU ARE QUIET BECAUSE THEIR WHITE KOSHER SPONSORS SUPPORT YEMENI GENOCIDE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eeqguicXPQ 

THE NORTHERN COASTAL STRIP OF YEMEN WAS ONCE PART OF DHOFAR RULED BY THE CALICUT KING..DHOFAR INCLUDED THE SOUTH PART OF OMAN TOO , INCLUDING THE CALICUT KINGs PRIVATE PORT SALALAH. OUR KING CHERALAN PERUMALs GRAVE IS STILL THERE .. I HAVE SEEN IT..

USA AND UN DID GENOCIDE IN VIETNAM , LAOS AND CAMBODIA --PAINTED POL POT AS A BAD DOG. IN REALITY POL POT WAS A HERO LIKE GADDAFI..

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/11/pol-pot-of-khmer-rouge-great-cambodian.html 

DEEP STATE controlled Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, ACLU and other groups claiming to support human rights had watched silently as the genocide is going on in Yemen..

Few days ago, 55 U.S. Senators voted to keep the war rolling along, 44 voted not to table the resolution to end it.

CHECK OUT THE HYPOCRISY IN THE POST BELOW-- SUNRISE IS BEING CONVERTED TO SUNSET WITH HELP FROM BILDERBERG CLUB SLAVE UN..

https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1006211 

A U.N. Security Council meeting did not address these genocidal attacks and instead chose to focus on rallying support for a war against Iran.

On Feb. 26 2018, Britain proposed a resolution in the U.N. Security Council blaming Iran for supporting so-called “terror activities” in Yemen.

Although the measure did not pass due to a veto from Russia ( THANK GOD FOR PUTIN ) , 11 out of 15 members supported its content. China and Kazakhstan abstained while Bolivia voted against the resolution.

If passed, this resolution could open the door to a NATO-led war against Iran.Of course Israel and Saudi Arabia will provide the funds. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley backed up this possibility, threatening “unilateral action” against the Islamic Republic.

“If Russia is going to continue to cover for Iran, then the U.S. and our partners need to take action on our own. If we’re not going to get action on the council, then we have to take our own actions,” MS THIN UPPER LIP Nikki Haley of DEEP STATE told reporters.

Shockingly the Security Council did not address Saudi Arabia’s war crimes and genocidal actions in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes and ground operations have killed and injured more than 43,000 Yemeni people in the past three years.

U.S. forces provide intelligence support for selecting airstrike targets. Riyadh’s airstrike campaign frequently targets markets, homes, cars, media crews, farms, factories, prisons and even ambulance crews entering bomb sites.

U.S. Navy ships enforce the siege and blockade throughout the Red Sea by prohibiting aid and cargo ships from docking in resistance-held territory, such as the Hodeidah port, where Saudi airstrikes destroyed the port’s cranes.

In May 2017, Trump visited the kingdom, signing a record $350 billion arms deal, the largest in US history.

WE WATCH !

IT WAS JEW ROTHSCHILD WHO PRESERVED MONKEYS IN INDIA CLAIMING THAT THEY ARE GODS

A MONKEY IS NOT EVEN USEFUL WHEN DEAD..

WHILE ALIVE THEY ARE DISEASE CARRIERS AND A MENACE

MONKEYS IN CITIES ARE TRAINED TO STEAL MOBILE PHONES , GOLD JEWELRY AND PURSES

“I had invested Rs 50,000 to plant corn on my 1.2-hectare (ha) farm. Monkeys completely destroyed it,” he says. Ironically, the drawing room where the meeting is convened has a big Hanuman calendar on its wall. “We worship Hanuman but these monkeys are not his descendants. They belong to the evil monkey king Bali who was slain by Lord Ram,”

http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/out-of-control-why-monkeys-are-a-menace-50817 

SORRY---

HANUMAN WAS A MONKEY

KING VALI AND HIS WIFE TARA WERE HUMANS.

TARA CURSED RAMA AND SINCE SHE WAS CHASTE THE CURSE TOOK EFFECT --AND HIS NEXT AVATAR KRISHNA WAS KILLED BY JARA

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2014/10/king-vali-and-queen-tara-of-ramayana.html 

WE INDIANS DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE HANUMAN TEMPLE BEFORE THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA..

TODAY WE HAVE 20 TIMES MORE HANUMAN TEMPLES THAN RAM TEMPLES.

ROTHSCHILD EVEN REMOVED THE GARUDA VAHANA ( VISHNUs CARRIER ) FROM ARJUNAs CHARIOT FLAG IN MAHABHARATA WAR AND INSERTED HANUMAN.

IN RAMAYANA THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD-- RAM..

DEVADASI WHORES WERE MARRIED OFF TO HANUMAN..

HANUMAN CHALISA WAS WRITTEN BY TULSIDAS IN AWADHI--TULSIDAS NEVER EXISTED

GORAKHPUR GITA PRESS WHICH PRINTED LAKHS OF HANUMAN CHALISA BOOKLETS WAS CREATED BY JEW ROTHSCHILD..

WE ASK--

EXTERMINATE THE MONKEYS IN CITIES --LEAVING SOME IN FORESTS --FOR ECOLOGICAL BALANCE

MONKEYS CAN BE TRAINED IN REMOVAL OF MINES..

Ramkumar Jayaraman March 25, 2018 at 12:43 PM Respected Captain,
Namaskaram. I have read your posts talking about yazhi a mythical creature in TN temples which you say to be fake. But I have seen these in all temples which are sculpted over 1000 years ago and that much perfection is impossible in the last 100 year's. Also they are almost everywhere in the temple showing its antiquity. After reading your post saying that the lion in Sri Lankan flag is Nilagiri Kadava, I just wanted to link this Yazhi with Nilagiri Kaduva. Requesting you to through some lights. 



Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 25, 2018 at 1:06 PM NARASIMHA AVATAR OF VISHNU IS HALF YAZHI ( NOT LION ) . 
YAZHI AND KADUVA IS THE SAME..

THESE FIERCE BIG CATS ( ON WESTERN GHATS ) WHO COULD EAT LIONS AND TIGERS FOR BREAKFAST IS NOW EXTINCT 
KURUVADWEEP IS NAMED AFTER VERY LARGE FIERCE TIGERS ( WITH NON RETRACTABLE CLAWS WHO HAVE BROWN SKIN ) IN THE ISLAND-- IN KERALA WE CALL THESE TIGERS KADUVA IN MALAYALAM

On Thiruvathira day we have Kaduva dance ( NARI KALI )

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2014/02/thiruvathira-karva-chauth-of-kerala.html

THE CHIPKO MOVEMENT WAS A FOREIGN FUNDED NGO MOVEMENT TO STALL THE PROGRESS OF INDIA..USING ILLITERATE FEMALES.. 

TWO INDIANS GOT THE DESH DROHI MAGSASAY AWARD -- CHANDI PRASAD BHATT AND SUNDERLAL BAHUGUNA 

THESE NGOs CAUSED THE BIRTH OF UTTARAKHAND STATE--.. 

23% OF UTTARAKAND STATE POPULATION IS BRAHMIN ( BY INDUCTION ) -- COMPARE THIS TO KERALA WITH 0.19% POPULATION BRAHMIN..  

15 August 1996, then Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda announced the formation of new state Uttaranchal from the Red Fort, Delhi. MOST OF THE DAMS IN THE UPPER PARTS OF THE GANGES ARE WHITE ELEPHANTS AND MUST BE DISMANTLED..-- THESE DAMS WERE SOLELY BUILT FOR POLITICIANS TO GET KICKBACKS..

WHO WAS BAHUGUNA BABY ?.. 

Sunderlal Bahuguna was a contractor engaged by forest department for felling of trees.  

One year he was not selected, and contract was awarded to someone else who quoted cheaper... 

Bahuguna baby resisted .. in order to hamper work he asked his men to surround the trees when workforce from other contractors came to fell tree.  

Benami media project his team as if they were environmentalists opposing felling of trees.  

This is how environmentalists are born overnight. 

HOW DID SRI SRI RAVISHANKAR AND SADGURU JAGGI VASUDEV BECOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS ? 

EMPEROR ASHOKA NEVER EXISTED--  BUT HEY, HE IS NOW AN ENVIRONMENTALIST ..

BAHUGUNA BABY IS A DESCENDANT OF PIR ALI MUSLIMS FROM BENGAL.. HE WAS A DISCIPLE OF DESH DROHI BRITISH DARLING SHRI DEV SUMAN-- WHO WAS A DISCIPLE OF ROTHSCHILD AGENT GANDHI. 

BAHUGUNA BABY WAS THE ORIGINAL FASTING GOAT ( WHO WILL EAT SECRETLY ) --  MAGSAYSAY AWARD WINNER ANNA HAZARE IS DUPLICATE-

ARUN JAITLEY AND PM MODI-

YOU ARE GUILTY OF SUPPORTING BITCOIN WHICH DOES MAXIMUM TO ENCOURAGE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY..

The blockchain ledger – an unchangeable, open register that lists every transactions ever made on the platform – has been used to store illegal content, including CHILD PORNOGRAPHY and privacy and copyright violations. Lawyers who understand International Law -- will vouch that anyone that owns Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency based on the blockchain, is breaking the law.. and will be punished.. 
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY renders the mere possession of a blockchain illegal..it is illegal to participate in a blockchain-based system as soon as it contains CHILD SEX content. 
Anyone that owns Bitcoin is breaking the law.

Any Finance minister or PM who supports Bitcoin is breaking the law-- and will be punished.

MODI / JAITLEY -- LISTEN UP--  YOUR LEGACY WILL BE WRITTEN BY CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL-- NOT WHITE JEWS...

Blockchain-based currencies have also been at the centre of a number of controversies, including when $230 million-worth of Ether was “accidentally” ( SIC ) deleted by a user....

IN NINE YEARS OF EXISTENCE , THE ONLY JOB BLOCKCHAIN HAS DONE IS TO REGULARISE GRABBED LAND ( BY WHITE JEWS ) IN ISRAEL AND GEORGIA..

EVERY BENAMI MEDIA TV STATION WAS GUILTY OF INCITING DALITS YESTERDAY…BY  LOADED MESSAGES  …

“ YES WE AGREE THAT DALITS WERE SUPRESSED BY HIGH CASTE HINDUS FOR MILLINIUMS –BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CAN TAKE LAW INTO YOUR OWN HANDS  “---BLAH BLAH..

THIS IS A TERRIFIC LIE..

THERE WAS NO CASTE SYSTEM TILL THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA…WE HAD ONLY A VARNA SYSTEM.. 
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2011/07/untouchables-capt-ajit-vadakayil.html 

ON THE SHIP EVERYBODY CANNOT BE CAPTAIN ..IF YOU HAVE TO BECOME CAPTAIN YOU HAVE TO PASS AN EXAM AND HAVE REQUISITE EXPERIENCE AND FAVOURABLE SERVICE REPORTS…

THE WHITE INVADER CREATED HUNDREDS OF FAKE HINDU MUTTS ONLY TO DIVIDE AND RULE… TO DO PROPAGANDA THAT THERE WAS UNTOUCHABILITY SYSTEM WHICH OPPRESSED THE DALITS..

SORRY---

UNTOUCHABILITY EXISTED ONLY IN KERALA… AND THAT TOO IT WAS STARTED 6000 YEARS AGO BY VISHNU AVATAR PARASHURAMA FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON..

AFTER CONVEYING VEDAS ORALLY FOR 330 CENTURIES IT WAS DECIDED TO PEN DOWN THE VEDAS 70 CENTURIES AGO..

THE HUMAN DNA WAS DEGRADING AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-FRACTAL MINDS TO MEMORISE SUCH HUMONGOUS AMOUNTS OF SANSKRIT VERSES..

FROM 5000 BC TO 4000 BC , IT WAS KERALA NAMBOODIRIS WHO CONVEYED VEDAS ORALLY – AS THEY COULD STILL DO IT..   THE WRITTEN VEDAS WERE IN THE CUSTODY ON KERALA NAMBOODIRIS AT THE BANKS OF THE RIVER SARASWATI..

NOW LISTEN—THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF THIS COMMENT…

IN 4000 BC ,RIVER SARASWATI DRIED UP DUE TO A TECTONIC SHIFT AT THE GLACIAL MOUTH IN THE HIMALAYAS…

THE BROTHER OF KRISHNA BALARAMA TOOK HIS GIGANTIC PLOW ( FOR LEVERAGE ) AND SHIFTED THE SARSWATI WATERS TO GANGA AND YAMUNA –LEAVING ONLY THE UNDERGROUND SARASWATI RIVER FLOWING..

BALARAMA WOULD WITNESS THE FINAL BATTLE BETWEEN DURYODHANA AND BHIMA IN A STAGNANT POOL OF SARSWATI RIVER IN 4000 BC ..

BEFORE THE KURUKSHETRA WAS COULD START , VISHNU TOOK AN AVATAR AS PARASHURAMA TO KEEP THE 4 VEDAS AND 108 UPANISHADS SAFE…  

PARASHURAMA LEAD THE KERALA NAMBOODIRIS BACK HOME FROM SARSWATI RIVER BANKS WITH THE VEDAS AND UPANISHADS .. THESE NAMBOODIRIS KNEW THE VEDAS BY ORAL ROUTE TOO…

THIYYAS WERE THE ORIGINAL ROYALS OF KERALA— LATER JEW ROTHSCHILD CREATED A CRYPTO JEW VARMA CLAN WHO BECAME KERALA ROYALS..

THERE WERE NO VARMAS BEFORE THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA… THIYYAS, WERE DEMOTED TO “ COCONUT TREE TODDY TAPPERS”..

SAME WAY MAHARS ( BR AMBEDKARs CLAN ) WERE NOT DALITS… MAHARS WERE RULING CASTE OF MAHARASHTRA … MAHARASTRA IS THE RASHTRA OF MAHARS…. LATER CHITPAVAN JEWS BECAME RULING CLASS. ..

PARASHURAMA CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE ONLY THE ELDEST NAMBOODIRI BROTHER COULD OWN FERTILE LAND IN KERALA …

THIS WAS TO PREVENT SUBDIVISION AND FRAGMENTATION OF FERTILE LAND WHICH IS INDIAs BIGGEST PROBLEM TODAY AND REASON FOR FARMERS SUICIDES..

NAMBOODIRIS GOT DRUNK WITH POWER ( SOCIAL STATUS, KNOWLEDGE , LAND AND WEALTH ) AND BECAME DECADENT IN THE PERIOD FROM 4000 BC TO 2000 BC..

DANAVAS OF KERALA HAS BEEN THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THIS PLANET.. I AM A DANAVA ..

IN 2000 BC A KERALA NAMBOODIRI NAMED ADI SHANKARACHARYA , CUT THE STRENGTH FROM UNDER THE FEET OF HIS OWN CLAN AND DISTRIBUTED THE 4 VEDAS TO THE 4 CORNERS OF INDIA.. .. HE FELT NAMBOODIRIS WERE SEXUALLY DECADENT ..

THERE GOES THE FALSE THEORY THAT THERE WAS NO CONCEPT OF BHARAT IN THE ANCIENT DAYS..

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2014/01/my-visit-to-sringeri-mutt-exhuming.html 

THERE WAS A CONDITION SET BY PARASHURAMA –THAT THESE 4 ORIGINAL HINDU MUTTS COULD BE HEADED ONLY BY A VEDA ( ORAL ROUTE ) KNOWING KERALA NAMBOODIRI PONTIFF…

THIS LONG TRADITION WAS BROKEN BY JEW ROTHSCHILD WHO RULED INDIA… EVEN THE 4 ORIGINAL MUTTS HAS CRYPTO JEW PONTIFFS WITH PALE EYES WHO TROUBLED DALITS.. ALONG WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND FAKE MUTT PONTIFFS WHO WERE THE BRIBED AGENTS OF THE WHITE INVADER…

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/06/kanchi-mutt-creation-of-white-invader.html 

INDIA IS RACING TO BE THIS PLANETs NO 1 SUPERPOWER IN ANOTHER 15 YEARS …

THE WHITE MAN WILL NEVER ALLOW A BROWN MAN TO LORD OVER HIM… ALL BR AMBEDKAR/ EVR PERIYAR STUDENTS UNION LEADERS ARE FUNDED AND CONTROLLED BY WHITE JEWS ….

BOTH BR AMBEDKAR AND EVR PERIYAR WERE AGENTS OF JEW ROTHSCHILD AND DID NOT WANT THE WHITE INVADER TO LEAVE INDIA…

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/10/the-only-dalit-freemason-of-india-capt.html 

YES THE COOK ON A SHIP CAN ASPIRE TO BE CAPTAIN.. BUT FIRST HE MUST PASS AN EXAM…

WE CANT HAVE QUOTA FOR DALITS IN ISRO OR A QUOTA FOR DONKEYS ON A RACE COURSE..

YOU CANT TEACH A DONKEY TO SING — WISDOM…

AS LONG AS THERE IS QUOTA SYSTEM , THERE WILL BE BRAIN DRAIN FROM INDIA …. NO HORSE WILL AGREE TO BE LORDED OVER BY A DONKEY ON A RACE COURSE..

BY ALL MEANS GIVE FREE EDUCATION TO DALITS—BUT IT MUST STOP THERE … GIVING JOB RESERVATIONS AND EVEN PROMOTIONS WILL NOT HELP BHARATMATA..

OUR CONSTIITUTION DEMANDS THAT ALL CITIZENS BE TREATED THE SAME.. 

DALIT LEADERS LIKE KANCHA ILAIAH AND JNU COMMIE PROFESSORS MUST NOT LONGER LIE THAT DALITS WERE SUPRESSED FOR MILLIUNIUMS ..

IT HAPPENED ONLY IN KERALA , NOT THE REST OF INDIA… UNTOUCHABILITY IN KERALA WAS TO PRESERVE , NOT SUPRESS..

The Malabar Group’s first state-of-the-art mall is all set to open in the South Indian city of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. Mall of Travancore is the largest shopping mall in the capital city and is designed to provide a world-class shopping experience to its visitors.The chief minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, will inaugurate the mall on Friday.The concept of setting up a mall under the Malabar Group was born in 2005.For this, the group’s representatives visited over 1,000 malls in India and abroad to get a hands-on experience about the functioning of malls. A detailed marketing study was conducted in Kerala. Based on these studies, it was decided to set up a mall in Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram). In 2006, the group started the process of acquiring seven acres of land in Enjakkal near the Thiruvananthapuram airport.The management decided to go green and embark on a completely eco-friendly construction. The height of the mall was limited to three floors since the property is adjacent to the Thiruvananthapuram Interna-tional Airport. On Nov. 27, 2014, the then-chief minister, Oommen Chandy, laid the foundation stone of the mall.Thiruvananthapuram is known for its centuries-old cultural heritage and economic prosperity. Being the capital city, it is home to numerous central and state PSUs (public sector undertakings) and establishments. The city’s population consists of highly educated, secular, cultured, and economically well-to-do people. A number of foreign tourists visit the famous Kovalam beach each year. These are some of the reasons that propelled the Malabar Group to chose Thiruvananthapuram as the location for its first mall.The three-floor mall is spread over 650,000-square-feet.The mall has a hypermarket, food plaza, seven multiplex theaters of the Carnival Group, gaming zone and a number of showrooms selling jewelry, electronics and home appliances, and lifestyle products. Around 300 brands including international names such as Adidas, Allen Solly, Apple, Arrow, Baskin Robbins, Bata, Delsey, Jockey, KFC, Lifestyle, Malabar Gold & Diamonds, Pantaloons, Park Avenue, Louis Philippe, Titan, Van Heusen, VIP, Eham Digital, Kalyan Silks and Woodland will be available in over 160 showrooms within the mall.",english

The march, 'Janajagratha Yatra', led by district secretary P Jayarajan, sought to expose the alleged false propaganda unleashed by the outfit 'Vayalkilikal' (Paddy Birds), which is spearheading the stir.
The CPI(M) rejected the contention of the agitators and said the party march was against the attempt of the outfit to put hurdles on the path of development.
Addressing a press meet, Taliparamba MLA James Mathew also deplored the agitation and said the government cannot remain a mute spectator in the matter of development.

Former Governor of Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan on Friday said the country should enable its workforce to move out of agriculture into industry and services, as income in the latter sectors is much higher. 
He said the society has always found ways to adapt to changing times even when there have been fears of machines replacing humans. 
""We have to try and give people the ability to move out of agriculture into industry and services, where income is much higher. We need to figure out ways to do this,"" Rajan said in Kochi. 
""What jobs will humans be able to do in 10-15 years that are immune from threat?

A few ‘birds’ in a paddy field in the red bastion of Kannur district are giving sleepless nights to the ruling CPI(M). While some say these birds in Keezhattoor village are harbingers of Kerala’s ‘Nandigram’—the village that launched massive protests that ensured the CPI(M) was almost eliminated from West Bengal—the Left is struggling to find ways to deal with its own ghosts from the past. 
Vayalkilikal , meaning birds in a paddy field is the name by which a group of farmers protesting against land acquisition for a NH bypass call themselves. Though few in numbers, the protesting group—comprising farmers and farm labourers—are determined to go to any length to stop their paddy fields from being reclaimed. 
“Till we are alive, we will not let the road pass through our paddy fields. It will destroy the entire area,” asserted Janaki, one of the leading faces of the agitation. And she means what she says. She had drenched herself in petrol and had held up cigarette lighters in their hands as NHAI officers had visited the village to survey the land. 
Keezhattoor, a scenic village surrounded by hills on three sides, is one of the most productive paddy areas in the district. 
The family of Janaki is one of the few who are opposing the NH. Most families in this red bastion, however, have agreed to part with the land. But what has put the CPI(M) in a fix is the fact that it is their own party cadre in the locality who are at the forefront of the agitation. Also, the fact that the agitation has caught the imagination of environmentalists across the state is creating a headache for the party. 
And the CPI(M), despite having a brute majority in the village, is finding it hard to navigate through this muddle. 
“The reality is that all families in the village, except four, has agreed to hand over the land for development. Very few people, who are being egged on by outsiders, are at the forefront of the agitation. These people are being used as pawns by the media and the agents of BJP,” said Rajesh V.S., a native of Keezhattoor, who has agreed to hand over the land. 
Rajesh, who is a member of the CPI(M), says that he also had opposed the earlier alignment of the NH as it meant destruction of many houses in the village. “Now, the new alignment destroys minimum land while providing a solution to traffic issues in the entire district,” he said. 
But leaders of the Vayalkilikal protest insist that the proposed bypass would sound a death knell for paddy cultivation and wetlands in the region. 
“Our paddy fields are narrow in size. If a 45 metre road passes through it, then the entire paddy cultivation will be destroyed. We will not allow that,” said Divakaran, one of the leaders. 
He also added that the government has not done any environmental impact study before going ahead with the plan. 
The protesters, however, insist that they are not against development. “All that we demand is that development should not be at the cost of environment,” he said, adding that they have suggested alternatives including an overbridge. 
The protesters have succeeded in roping in activists including Medha Patkar and Daya Bhai in support of their struggle Environmentalists and activists are planning to take out a march to Keezhattoor on March 25, pledging solidarity with the protesters. 
The CPI(M) leadership, however, looks determined. 
“The current protest is part of a conspiracy to taint the LDF government. The opponents of the CPI(M) are scared that if CPI(M) brings in development, they will lose the only weapon they have against it. We will find a solution,” said party state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, reiterating his focus on ‘development’, said that the protest is unnecessary. “We will provide financial compensation to those affected by projects and will also rehabilitate those who lose their land. If protests continue, we have no option but to go ahead with development works. Development is our main agenda,” he said. 
The CPI(M) argues that the real issue behind the protest is not loss of paddy field. “After this government has come to power, 49,000 hectares of paddy field, which were lying barren till then, have been brought back to cultivation. Nobody talks about that and they go on harping about the 11 acres of paddy land, which will be lost,” said an official at the CMO. 
According to him, the protesters are playing into the hands of the BJP. 
This allegation has some truth, in a way, as it is the BJP, which is making the most out of the protest. Many senior BJP leaders pay regular visits to the area. BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan, a known environmentalist, is at the forefront of supporting the protesters. Criticising the ‘anti-farmer policies of the LDF’, Rajasekharan has announced that BJP will actively participate in the protest march to be taken out on March 25. 
While the CPI(M) maintains that the issue has been blown out of proportion by parties with “vested interests”, political observers feel that the CPI(M) is indeed paying for its own past sins. 
“The CPI(M) had always been at the forefront of opposing many development initiatives—whether it was computers or the Kochi Airport. And now, when it has become an active proponent of development all of a sudden, the cadre may not be able to digest it immediately. Keezhattoor agitation is one such example,” said Jayaprakash K., a political observer. 
According to him, it may be easier for the leadership to speak a different language but for the ordinary cadre, fed on a certain kind of ideology for years, it will take a longer time. 
Till then, Nandigram-like episodes are bound to haunt the CPI(M).

Kochi: The global economic recovery could be hit if the trade war between the US and China escalate, renowned economist and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Friday. 
""There are very worrisome scenarios here. I think we should not take this lightly,"" he said here. 
""I do hope that better sense sort of prevails and we move off from a full-fledged process of one country doing it and the other country reacting and so on,"" he said. 
Raghuram Rajan, Professor of Finance, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, advised that one should stay away from ""trade war particularly at a time when the economy the world over was in the process of recovery."" ""I don't want to use the word trade war. I don't think they are there yet. But I do think that it is very important that we stay away because it could harm the current recovery which has been beneficial all over the world significantly. 
""And for it to do that at a time when the US is quite strong and has got full employment is going quite reasonably, it seems to me that this is not the time that we should do it,"" the former RBI governor told reporters in response to a question related to trade war. 
The former RBI governor is in India to address the two-day Global Digital Summit (#Future) organised by the Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala.

The march, 'Janajagratha Yatra',led by district secretary P Jayarajan, sought to expose the alleged false propaganda unleashed by the outfit ' Vayalkilikal ' (Paddy Birds), which is spearheading the stir. 

The CPI(M) rejected the contention of the agitators and said the party march was against the attempt of the outfit to put hurdles on the path of development. 

Addressing a press meet here, Taliparamba MLA James Mathew also deplored the agitation and said the government cannot remain a mute spectator in the matter of development. 

The agitators, comprising farmers and local people, alleged that the government proposal would destroy more than 200 acres of paddy field, leaving many people homeless and jobless at Keezhattur village and surrounding area. 

It would also result in destruction of wetland of the area, they said, adding that their fight is for the protection of environment and livelihood. 

The agitation has taken a political turn as most of the participants are former CPI(M) workers, who were expelled from the party after taking part in the stir. 

Though the outfit 'Vayalkilikal' had been on a warpath for the past three months, the agitation came into focus after a group of persons, stated to be CPI(M) activists, set fire to a temporary shed of the protesters on March 14. 

It was on the same day that a National Highway Authority of India team had arrived in the area for surveying. 

In a related development, the house of the 'Vayalkili' leader Suresh Keezhattoor was attacked by a group of unidentified persons on March 22. 

Meanwhile, in a bid to overcome the stalemate over the land acquisition issue, PWD minister G Sudhakaran has written0 to the Centre, seeking the possibility of constructing a flyover in the area. 

The minister said the state had written to union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari in this regard. 

The issue had also figured in the ongoing session of the state Assembly, where the Congress-led UDF opposition alleged that the CPI(M) government was trying to suppress the agitation of farmers. 

However,Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had maintained that the government would not backtrack from the land acquisition for development purpose and termed the agitation as ""anti-democratic and anti-development"". 

The CM had also said that 56 of the total 60 land owners in Keezhattur had already given consent letters for the acquisition.",english

K. Ramachandran and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan during the inauguration of K-DISC in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday. (Photo: A.V.MUZAFAR) THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC), the state’s strategic think-tank that was unveiled on Saturday, will function less like a closed exclusive group and more like ‘open source software’. It wants its innovations to be powered by mass collaboration. As a first step, K-DISC will tap the Malayali scientific Diaspora. “The plan is to swiftly form a pool of at least 20,000 Malayali scientific experts working outside the state,” said Dr K. M. Abraham, the chairman of K-DISC. For this, the platform created by the Loka Kerala Sabha will be leveraged. “The chief minister will write to the attendees of Loka Kerala Sabha to identify experts in various scientific fields, from nuclear science to nano technology. Once the credentials of these nominees are validated, we will ask them to contribute to K-DISC’s innovation and strategy development process,” Dr Abraham said. In short, they will function as a sort of super mentors of K-DISC.
Dr Abraham estimates that there would be at least one lakh Malayalis proficient in the various sciences scattered all over the world. “In a way, K-DISC offers our non-resident luminaries a medium through which to contribute generously to the growth of their home state,” Dr Abraham said. Kerala as Blockchain hub: K-DISC has already initiated steps to put Kerala at the cutting edge of technology. The ‘Blockchain Competency Development Programme’, which it will provide through Kerala Blockchain Academy, is a case in point. Blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, does away with a central server, and uses a distributed ledger system. Every single transaction is recorded, and once it is recorded in the blockchain, it cannot be changed.
“It works on consensus-based system,” said Dr S. Ashraf, IITM-K professor and the man leading the state's blockchain charge. “Only when and if the other ‘participating nodes’ or persons involved in the ecosystem agree to something that has been proposed will a new data go into the system,” he said. The idea is to create an army of 50,000 Blockchain technologists in three years. “When world leaders in technology are looking for skilled blockchain people, Kerala should be the place to look for,” Dr Abraham said. The state already has the first mover advantage. There is no blockchain academy or institute anywhere else in the state. (Telengana plans to start a blockchain college but it is still on paper.) Placing bets on blockchain technology seems sound. A recent global study states that the market size of blockchain technology is expected to grow by 300 percent in the next five years.
Research is also at an advanced stage on how to use the blockchain technology for various governance projects as the technology is tamper-proof and transparent. K-DISC is already in talks with Michael Gord, the founder and CEO of MLG Blockchain, and Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the founder of BITNATION, to adapt some of the blockchain-related projects they have implemented. BITNATION, which calls itself a 'decentralised borderless voluntary nation', for instance is working to provide water purification kits to families in impoverished areas. It has also developed a system to track law and order in South Africa. Dr Abraham, however, is interested in using the blockchain technology for storing land records. “Now the resurvey mechanism is such a mess because the existing data has been tampered with or is wrong,” he said. Kerala Blockchain Academy has evolved a system called Skillchain, a blockchain based job portal for unorganised or informal sector.",english

Among those who led the march were former State Congress President V.M. Sudheeran, Bharatiya Janata Party MP and superstar Suresh Gopi, six-time Independent legislator P.C. George, Aam Aadmi Party leader C.R. Neelakandan and several environmentalists. The protest came a day after top leadership of the ruling Communist Party of India-Marxist’s local unit, which is strongly supporting the by-pass, took to the streets here shouting slogans against the protesters, saying they have an “anti-development” agenda and calling to isolate them. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the district CPI-M leadership however contend that a total of 11.5 acres of paddy fields is being taken and all, except four people, have agreed to it. They accused “vested interests behind the protesters of misleading the hapless local populace”. ALSO READ: UN calls for calm after 'violent' refugee protest in Rwanda However, in Sunday’s protest, Sudheeran said he is surprised to see that while the CPI-M lead protests against taking over farm lands for development in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, here they are the biggest supporters for it. “What must be noted is that no environment and social impact assessment study was undertaken nor was an expert opinion sought for this proposed alignment. The National Highways Authority of India and the Kerala government have joined hands to destroy the paddy fields, which is the source of employment for many here. In no way will we allow this paddy lands to be taken over for the by-pass,” he said. Asking Chief Minister Vijayan to intervene and settle this issue as the protesters have a genuine case, Gopi said: “My state party president has briefed a cross section of the Union Ministers stating that the present alignment has to be changed as the demands of the protesters are genuine”. ALSO READ: Kannur Youth Congress worker's murder: Kerala HC stays CBI probe “The Union government is only willing to help resolve this issue as the protesters are not against the by-pass but are against this present alignment,”he added. George went a step forward and asked Vijayan to explain the fact that arrangements have been done with a group for Rs 70 crore as eight lakh lorry loads of mud are required to fill up this paddy field for constructing the by-pass. “If the CPI-M leadership here do not learn from what happened in West Bengal and Tripura, then they are in for bad times. No one is against development at all… it’s the manner in which development is forced on hapless people, that is being opposed,” he said. Incidentally , the protest is taking place at one of the strongholds of the CPI-M in Kannur and most of the protesters are all hardcore CPI-M activists. But with the Vijayan government adamant, they decided to seek the support of all people who support the environment.

Earlier this month, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had informed the Assembly that the DLCCs in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kannur, and Kasaragod would soon begin handling applications for housing from coastal communities. He said the committees would be equipped to process applications for construction of houses up to 66 sq m. 
Applications pile up 
The government move to activate DLCCs followed a shrill demand from coastal communities to expedite the processing of applications that had been piling up at the office of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA). Official sources said the last meeting of KCZMA had over 600 items on its agenda, the lion’s share being applications for construction of residential buildings. 
But experts point out that DLCCs are still not equipped to fulfil their primary mandate of assisting the implementation of CRZ norms. “Beyond handling applications for housing, there has been little progress in empowering the committees for coastal regulation and putting the brakes on coastal zone violations,” says K.V. Thomas, former member, KCZMA. 
Officials point out that States like Karnataka, Gujarat, and Maharashtra have empowered district committees to verify complaints about CRZ violations and act on them. 
The DLCC in Kerala has seven members, with the District Magistrate as chairperson and District Town Planner as member secretary. Other members on the panel include the Deputy Director, Panchayats; Assistant Conservator of Forests; and three representatives of the local traditional community. 
The formation of DLCCs in the nine coastal districts in Kerala takes the number of people involved in coastal governance from 12 (number of members in KCZMA) to 75. 
Allegations 
“Decentralised coastal governance will remain a non-starter in Kerala unless there is a serious effort to equip the DLCCs to fulfil their mandate,” says T. Peter, Secretary, National Fishworkers Forum.",english

Kerala’s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) may not have anticipated that it would have to bat for a road it opposed while it was in the Opposition three years ago. 
The party is faced with such a predicament at Keezhattur, a party village in its citadel of Kannur, with a section of the party cadres and supporters carrying forward the stir it had dropped after coming to power in May 2016. 
The bone of contention was the acquisition of 250 acres of pristine paddy fields for building a national highway bypass through the agrarian village. The CPM had opposed all the three alignments proposed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for the bypass while it was in the Opposition. 
The main argument was that it would sound the death knell for the paddy cultivation in the village and upset the ecosystem, leading to severe water shortage and other irreparable environmental hazards. However, the party changed its mind after the government led by it assumed office. Protests against the road bypass at Keezhattur in Kannur district. K Sasi 
The leaders, who had spearheaded the agitation under the auspices of an action committee, backed out after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan made it clear that “development was the main agenda” of his government and there will be “no scope for protests” under his dispensation. 
However, a small group of 60 farmers led by Suresh Keezhattur defied the diktat and persisted with the stir under the banner of a collective called “Vayalkilikal” (literally, paddy birds), braving the repressive measures unleashed by the government and the party. 
The CPM has been trying everything in its power to suppress the agitation. Eleven party members, who had associated with the agitation, were expelled from the party. An employment ban was imposed on Suresh’s brother Ratheesh Chandroth, a head load worker registered with its trade union wing, for taking part in the agitation. 
A wooden tent the farmers erected for the agitation was set ablaze allegedly by CPM workers from the neighbouring village on 14 March. This was after the farmers tried to prevent the NHAI officials who came for a survey of the land. 
The party tried to turn the residents in the village against the agitators by dubbing the latter as anti-development. The party also sought to isolate Vayalkilikal by barring outsiders supporting them from entering the village. A ‘kaval pura’ (watch-house) was set up in the field to check the activities of the outsiders. 
The party Kannur leadership has been batting for the bypass through the village even after the state government relented a little and urged the Union government to explore the possibility of building an elevated highway in place of the bypass in the light of the mounting protests against the acquisition of the paddy fields. 
The party organised a march from Keezhattur to nearby Taliparamba town with a declaration that the bypass will be built as per the current alignment couple of days after Public Works Minister G Sudhakaran wrote a letter to Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari suggesting the elevated highway in view of the mounting protests against the bypass. 
Before the march, the proposed NH alignment was marked using red ribbons and putting up boards and party flags in the fields of those who have claimed to have given their consent for giving the land. 
Unperturbed by the repressive measures, the farmers kicked off the second phase of their agitation on 25 March by holding a massive march titled ‘Kerala to Keezhattur’ from Taliparamba to Keezhattur. Social and environmental activists and politicians from across the state participated in the march held under the aegis of the Keezhattur agitation solidarity committee. Protests at Keezhattur.

The Vayalkilikal declared their intention to continue the struggle by re-erecting the tent burnt by the CPM workers. Nambradath Janaki, a 68-year-old farmer, who inaugurated a public meeting at the culmination of the march at the Keezhattur field, declared they will continue the fight till the government drops its stand on building the bypass through the paddy fields. She said she will not allow the road to come at the village until she dies. 
Actor and Rajya Sabha member Suresh Gopi said that the farmers’ agitation in Kizhaattur was not only for the conservation of paddy fields and wetlands but also against the authoritarian approach of the Left Democratic Front government and the CPM. 
“The CPM has gained roots in Kerala through struggles. How can such a party show such intolerance towards an agitation being staged by poor farmers for a genuine cause? All people who love the environment will support the agitation,” he added. 
Former state Congress chief VM Sudheeran accused the government of acting like a feudal lord. He urged the government to shed its ego and find an amicable solution to the problem raised by the farmers in a democratic manner. 
“The same CPM which led the farmers agitations in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh has adopted the approach of rejecting the demands of the farmers in Keezhattur. I had not expected the CPM to take such a stand. One can oppose or agree to agitations but the party should not question the right of people conduct the agitations,” he added. 
The CPM has been opposing the agitation claiming that the agitators were a tiny minority and they had no support of the people. However, the massive attendance at the march has shaken the party so much so that it even dropped its threat to prevent outsiders from entering the village. 
The Kannur party leadership had instructed the party cadres not to even show up at the march as any trouble would give mileage to the agitators. Kannur district secretary P Jayarajan had earlier claimed that 56 out of 60 farmers in the village had given their consent to give their land. 
“The remaining four farmers are pawns in the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). We will not allow the agenda of the Sangh Parivar to succeed. The majority of the people in the village are for the bypass and the development it will bring,” he added. 
However, Suresh Keezhattur termed the claim a big lie. He said that the majority of the farmers in the village had not given their consent. According to him, the CPM has prepared the list by including those who have no land in the village. 
As regards the party claim that the agitators had no support of the people, he said that the people who care about the future of the state have been supporting them. He said that the CPM cadres have started realising that the ideology that the party leaders flaunt is for the sake of power. 
“We have the support of genuine party workers who hold the ideology and party programmes sacrosanct,” he added.

If realized, Nissan would be the biggest company in Technopark.
A Nissan delegation led by corporate vice-president and chief information officer Tony Thomas was in the city on Sunday to assess the facility and hold talks with the chief minister and other officials. “We have long-term strategies for growth. India is a potential choice. Of course, Kerala is on the radar too,” said a senior Nissan official.
It is learnt that Nissan is also considering Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Warangal to start its facility. A few destinations in North America, Europe and China are also under consideration. “We conceive the digital hub as an eco-system to promote innovation. We would like to collaborate with universities and other scientific organisations,” the official said.
The digital hub will be a research and development facility that will be shared by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, a Franco-Japanese strategic partnership. A team of highly talented engineers and scientists will work at the facility for creating innovations in automated and electronic vehicles. What makes Thiruvananthapuram attractive is the global talent pool in IT and engineering who have roots in the state. The startup promotional initiatives of the government and the fast move to create a social infrastructure supporting the industry are other advantages. The digital hub will create 300 to 500 high-end jobs in the first phase.
Government sources said the state started pitching for the project three months ago. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had directly written to the Nissan CEO, inviting him to set up the hub in Kerala. “The CM even assured that he would personally monitor each step and ensure that the facility will have a smooth launch,” said a source. Last week, state innovation council chairman K M Abraham and IT secretary M Sivasankar had visited the Nissan headquarters in Yokohoma and given a presentation on what the state can offer.
On Sunday, the Nissan delegation also had discussions with Union MoS Alphons Kannanthanam and Shashi Tharoor, MP who offered all support to them.

Though landowners had launched protest months ago under the banner of NH action council, they failed to get support from any political party.
National general secretary of the party P K Kunhalikutty on Sunday came up against the ongoing survey process saying that the boundary-marking process is illegal and it is against the fundamental rights.
Addressing the media here, Kunhalikutty said that the party would seek the support of state UDF leadership for launching a protest joining hands with landowners. He said that MLAs of the party would meet chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the coming days to bring the issue into his notice and they will also raise the issue in the assembly.
Kunhalikutty said that forceful acquisition of land is considered as encroachment with the support of state. He has ruled out the statement of local affairs minister K T Jaleel that external forces are behind the protest as baseless.
“Government should be ready to announce compensation package for each landowner before starting the survey”, he said.
“Many small houses have to be demolished in at AR Nagar panchayat alone and authorities should stop the survey process,” he said.
It is believed that the support from IUML will give a fresh lease of life to protesters.
It was on March 19 that the revenue authorities commenced the survey process from Kuttippuram amid strong protest from landowners. But the survey process went on smoothly with tight police security. On Friday, the district collector Amit Meena had informed that more staff would be appointed to speed up survey process.",english

Photo: Soman 
The Communist Party of India-Marxist governed the northeastern state of Tripura for the last 25 years. This changed on March 3with the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Jisnu Deb Burman being elected the new Chief Minister of Tripura. The BJP’s alliance with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura ensured a combined two-thirds majority in the legislative assembly for Tripura, which was previously a political stronghold of the Left. 
Just days after the CPI(M) was defeated at the polls in Tripura despite winning 46 percent of the vote, mobs of BJP members pulled down two statues of the revered Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in the towns of Sabroom and Belonia. 
Since the election results, a reign of terror has been unleashed on the Left parties and their supporters by the now ruling-party BJP members and its IPFT allies. Some 400 offices of the Left parties in Tripura have been attacked, 85 of them burned down, 315 of the offices forcibly occupied. But the BJP’s terror campaign does not stop there. The homes of 1,704 Left members and supporters were attacked, and 200 of the houses set on fire. 
In response, thousands of communists across India took to the streets protesting the destruction of Lenin’s statues and condemning the vigilante violence of the BJP goons. 
Realignment of political forces in Tripura 
The CPI(M) is the dominant party in the Left Front, a political alliance between the CPI(M), the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the All India Forward Bloc, that had won all except one election in Tripura since 1977. 
The people-centered policies of the Left Front explain why it had won five successive election terms in Tripura. The literacy rate for Tripura in 1971 was a mere 30.98 percent. Today, due to the Left Front government’s mass education program, Tripura stands at the top with a literacy rate of 94.65 percent, the highest in the country, even surpassing Kerala’s 93.61 percent (a state that has also historically been governed by the CPI(M)). 
Manik Sarkar, the outgoing communist Chief Minister of 20 years, was named “India’s poorest chief minister,” for maintaining a simple working-class lifestyle in a capitalist country like India where politicians in power are used to luxurious homes and lavish living while hundreds of millions of Indians live in extreme poverty. 
The BJP’s win in Tripura can be attributed to its tactical alliance with the IPFT, which allowed it to sweep in 33 percent of the total Assembly seats reserved for members of tribal (indigenous) groups as part of affirmative action policies. The liberal middle-class of Tripura heavily voted for the BJP-IPFT, blaming mass unemployment, a characteristic of the capitalist economic system, on the policies of the Left Front. During his time in power, Manik Sarkar, the representative of the CPI(M) and Left Front, refused to meet with CEOs of IT companies and refused to sell out Tripura to the for-profit interests of large corporations. 
While the upper-class strata of Tripura paints the Left Front government as “anti-development” and “anti-progress,” really what their crocodile tears are about is the prevention of unrestricted investment and development of Tripura at the expense of driving down wages and scrapping hard-won rights and protections for the working-class. It is very telling that the rural lower-caste Bengalis and many poor farmers continue to extend their support to the Left. 
The game plan of the right 
Despite the defeat the Left in Tripura took in the recent election, it still remains a strong force in the state. This is precisely why the BJP-IPFT coalition forces are resorting to fascistic tactics and the use of mass violence to reap fear in the minds of the people of Tripura, to keep them from joining the resistance to both the economic and ideological onslaught of the Hindu-supremacist neoliberal BJP. 
Let’s not forget that the ruling-party in India today, the BJP, originates from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a fascistic paramilitary force with over 50,000 units all across India that pushes for the Hinduization of India, upholds the despicable caste system, the repression of women and reactionary nationalism. This relationship between the BJP and the RSS is why the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, does not condemn the more than a dozen cases of lynchings, mostly against Muslims, or address the violence inflicted on oppressed people by cow-vigilante anti-beef eating groups. 
These recent terror attacks of the BJP-RSS in Tripura are by no means uncoordinated or arbitrary attacks by peripheral forces, but are occuring in a centralized way under the BJP-IPFT leadership. 
Upon the toppling of one of Lenin’s statues in Tripura, the BJP justified this rogue act by claiming that the statue was taken down by those who were being “oppressed” by the Left! In the same vein, liberal politicians are proving themselves to be the cowards that they are by condemning “violence on both sides,” when the lives of those fighting for equality and justice in society are under threat. 
Progressive forces in India and across the world must condemn the violence of the BJP forces for what it is: an attempt to crush and debilitate the Left in Tripura by any means necessary while the BJP is in power. This BJP terror campaign extends beyond Tripura, and is simply a part of the larger anti-communist witch hunt at the national level. 
Earlier this month, the CPI(M) played a significant role in mobilizing over 35,000 farmers for a 180 km long march in the Southwestern state of Maharastra against the ruling BJP and its neoliberal policies with the rise in farmers’ suicides that number in the tens of thousands every year. This action forced the government to grant many of the farmers’ demands. 
Unwilling and incapable of addressing the ills plaguing the lives of the Indian working-class and oppressed, the capitalist BJP-RSS turns to terror at every turn to remain in power. 
Not only is the BJP unfit to govern any part of India given its track record, what the BJP-RSS wish for is to wipe out communists from India. As Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan remarked, let it be known to the world that communists will not cease to exist in India by pulling down a few statues. So long as the terror of capitalism and the fascist ideologies that stem from it reign in India, the case for socialism will remain!",english

They joined the Vayalkililkal in a rally that began from Thaliparamba and concluded at Keezhattur paddy fields, where a public meeting was held. The meeting marked the beginning of the second phase of agitation against the bypass, which was inaugurated by activist Nambradath Janaki.
Congress leader V M Sudheeran, BJP leader B Gopalakrishnan , MLA P C George, Rajya Sabha member Suresh Gopi, RMPI leader N Venu and social activists A Vasu and C R Neelakandan were among those who participated in the rally.
Considering the volatile situation, a large posse of police was deployed but the programme was held peacefully and the CPM kept away from the locality and ‘boycotted’ Vayalkilikal, whom they had branded ‘vultures’.
Activist Suresh Keezhattur, who read out the ‘Keezhattur Declaration’ at the meeting, said development should not be at the cost of nature. V M Sudheeran, who addressed the meeting organized by the committee formed to express solidarity with the agitators, said development should also consider the people’s interest. The government should consider the alternatives proposed by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) the Congress leader demanded.
Suresh Gopi, who addressed the gathering pleaded to CM Pinarayi Vijayan to solve the logjam amicably, and said that the Centre would extend all support.
Though all the political parties in Kerala had reached a consensus about 30m width for the highway in Kerala, it was sabotaged in six months and made it to 45m, alleged P C George, who said that a number of hills would have to be demolished and there was corruption involved.
BJP leader Gopalakrishnan, said corruption was not limited to demolishing hills but mining of clay from the paddy fields in the guise of developing the bypass. The agitation garnered public support after the makeshift shed built by the agitators was set afire, allegedly by the CPM, after the protesters were arrested on March 14.
The BJP seems to have a larger game plan by extending support to the agitation. As part of the BJP march extending support to Keezhattur agitation on April 3, the farmers from Nandigram, who fought against the CPM, will visit Keezhattur, said BJP leader Gopalakrishnan.
Meanwhile in Kochi, ruling out further talks with the protesters, PWD minister G Sudhakaran said Vayalkilikal lacked an alternative solution. Claiming that more than 55 land owners had consented to acquisition, he said the UDF government had made the bypass plan.",english

Hundreds of farmers and people from all over Kerala took out a march here today against construction of a bypass road through paddy fields in Keezhattur area in the district, police said. 
Among those who took part in the agitation were former KPCC president V M Sudheeran, BJP Rajya Sabha MP and actor Suresh Gopi, P C George, MLA, and environmental actvist Hareesh Vasudevan. 
Police said there was no untoward incident and the march went off peacefully. 
Later, speaking at a public meeting, Sudheeran flayed the state government for allegedly not considering the views of the people. 
""I did not expect that CPI(M) will take such a stance. The same tactics and methods adopted by the feudal lords against the communist movement are being adopted by CPI(M) leaders against the agitators,"" he said. 
""Now, the people of Kerala have understood the games played by the ruling party,"" he added. 
Suresh Gopi said he would take up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to resolve the issue amicably. 
Yesterday, the CPI(M) district committee had taken out a march to protest against the decision of the state government to go ahead with the road project. 
The 'Janajagratha Yatra' march sought to expose the alleged false propaganda unleashed by 'Vayalkilikal' (Paddy Birds) outfit, which is spearheading the stir. 
The CPI(M) had rejected the contention of the agitators and said the march was against the attempt of the outfit to place hurdles in the path of development. 
The agitators, comprising farmers and local people, alleged that the government proposal would destroy over 200 acres of paddy field, leaving many people homeless and jobless in Keezhattur and surrounding areas. 
It would also result in the destruction of wetland in the area, they said, adding that their fight is for the protection of the environment and livelihood. 
The agitation has taken a political turn as most of the participants were former CPI(M) workers, who were expelled from the party forr taking part in the stir. 
Though the outfit 'Vayalkilikal' had been on a warpath for the past three months, the agitation came into focus after a group of persons, stated to be CPI-M activists, set fire to a temporary shed of the protesters on March 14, the day a team of officials of the National Highway Authority of India had arrived in the area for surveying. 
In a related development, the house of the 'Vayalkili' leader Suresh Keezhattoor was attacked by a group of unidentified people on March 22.

Among those who took part in the agitation were former KPCC president V M Sudheeran, BJP Rajya Sabha MP and actor Suresh Gopi, P C George, MLA, and environmental actvist Hareesh Vasudevan. Police said there was no untoward incident and the march went off peacefully. Later, speaking at a public meeting, Sudheeran flayed the state government for allegedly not considering the views of the people. "" I did not expect that CPI(M) will take such a stance. The same tactics and methods adopted by the feudal lords against the communist movement are being adopted by CPI(M) leaders against the agitators,"" he said. "" Now, the people of Kerala have understood the games played by the ruling party,"" he added. Suresh Gopi said he would take up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to resolve the issue amicably. On Saturday, the CPI(M) district committee had taken out a march to protest against the decision of the state government to go ahead with the road project. The 'Janajagratha Yatra' march sought to expose the alleged false propaganda unleashed by 'Vayalkilikal' (Paddy Birds) outfit, which is spearheading the stir. The CPI(M) had rejected the contention of the agitators and said the march was against the attempt of the outfit to place hurdles in the path of development. The agitators, comprising farmers and local people, alleged that the government proposal would destroy over 200 acres of paddy field, leaving many people homeless and jobless in Keezhattur and surrounding areas. It would also result in the destruction of wetland in the area, they said, adding that their fight is for the protection of the environment and livelihood. The agitation has taken a political turn as most of the participants were former CPI(M) workers, who were expelled from the party forr taking part in the stir. Though the outfit 'Vayalkilikal' had been on a warpath for the past three months, the agitation came into focus after a group of persons, stated to be CPI-M activists, set fire to a temporary shed of the protesters on March 14, the day a team of officials of the National Highway Authority of India had arrived in the area for surveying. In a related development, the house of the 'Vayalkili' leader Suresh Keezhattoor was attacked by a group of unidentified people on March 22.",english

നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടിൽ മാറ്റം വരരുതെന്ന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്ന ചിലരുണ്ട്. നല്ല കാര്യങ്ങൾ നടത്തുന്നതിനു ചിലർ തടസ്സമാകുന്നു. എതിർപ്പുള്ളവരുടെയെല്ലാം എതിർപ്പ് അവസാനിപ്പിച്ചു വികസനം കൊണ്ടുവരിക പ്രായോഗികമല്ല. വികസനത്തിന് എതിരു നിൽക്കുന്ന രീതി സർക്കാരിന്റെ ഭാഗത്തുനിന്നുണ്ടാകില്ലെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി കോഴിക്കോട് വ്യക്തമാക്കിയിരുന്നു. 
അതേസമയം, കണ്ണൂർ കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ വയൽ നികത്തി ബൈപാസ് നിർമിക്കുന്നതിൽനിന്നു സർക്കാർ പിൻമാറിയില്ലെങ്കിൽ സമര രീതി മാറ്റാനുള്ള തയാറെടുപ്പിലാണു വയൽക്കിളികൾ. എല്ലാ ബദൽ മാർഗങ്ങളും അടഞ്ഞാൽ മാത്രം വയൽ വഴി ആകാശപ്പാത നിർമിക്കുന്ന കാര്യത്തിൽ തീരുമാനമെടുക്കാമെന്ന നിലപാടിലാണു വയൽക്കിളികൾ. അതേസമയം സമരത്തിനു പിന്തുണയുമായി നന്ദിഗ്രാമിലെ കർഷകരെ കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെത്തിക്കുമെന്ന് ബിജെപി അറിയിച്ചു. 
അതിനിടെ, കീഴാറ്റൂർ സമരം മാധ്യമസൃഷ്ടിയാണെന്നു മന്ത്രി എം.എം. മണി അഭിപ്രായപ്പെട്ടു. രണ്ടോ നാലോ പേർക്കു വേണ്ടി മാത്രമുള്ളതാണു വയൽക്കിളികളുടെ സമരം. സമരക്കാരെ ഇളക്കിവിടുന്നതു മാധ്യമങ്ങളാണെന്നും എം.എം. മണി കോതമംഗലത്തു പറഞ്ഞു. × Advertisement related stories",malayalam

Japanese automotive major Nissan might set up a digital hub in Kerala. A Nissan delegation led by Corporate Vice-President and Chief Information Officer Tony Thomas recently met state officials to explore further possibilities around the deal. 
If realised, the facility will be set up in Kerala’s IT park, TechnoPark. As per reports, the digital hub will basically work as an R&D centre for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, as part of the Franco-Japanese strategic partnership. The facility will be a host to a team of engineers and scientists working to create innovations in automated and electronic vehicles space. 
The digital hub is further expected to create 300 to 500 high-end jobs in the first phase. 
Apart from Kerala, Nissan is also considering other cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Warangal to start its facility. 
“A few destinations in North America, Europe, and China are also under consideration. We conceive the digital hub as an ecosystem to promote innovation. We would like to collaborate with universities and other scientific organisations,” the Nissan official said in a media statement. 
Kerala, apart from holding the title of the only 100% literate state of India, is also raising its flag high on becoming a global hub for startups. The initiatives such as Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), Startup Village as well as government initiatives like setting up of $78 Mn fund of funds for Kerala based startups , have boosted the state’s image as a sheer supporter of innovation and creativity.

Recently Kerala also hosted the first global digital summit, #Future, to make its mark on the global charts as an IT hub for future technologies. 
As per reports, even for the Nissan R&D Centre, it was the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan , who reached out to the Japanese major and invited him to set up a digital hub in Kerala, giving full assurance of a smooth launch. 
The reports further claimed that earlier this month “ state innovation council chairman K M Abraham and IT secretary M Sivasankar had visited the Nissan headquarters in Yokohama and given a presentation on what the state can offer.” 
Another media source has also claimed that the deal has in-principle approval. According to him, “the arrival of Nissan digital hub would be shot in the arm for the government to attract global companies and retain top talents.” 
Nissan is trying to set up a digital hub in India at a time when the Indian government itself is striving to transform the country into an electric vehicle nation by 2030. Further, Nissan, Renault, and Mitsubishi Motors, also have plans to launch 17 electric models to achieve annual vehicle sales totaling 14 Mn units by 2022 , compared with 10.6 Mn units in 2017. 
Also, as reported earlier by Inc42 , with Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi alliance, the trio is looking to launch a $1 Bn fund for auto tech startups across the globe. Dubbed as Alliance Ventures, the fund will be used to back promising mobility startups that are working on innovative solutions over the next five years. As per reports, the three companies will invest around $200 Mn during the VC fund’s first year . Some of the key areas that the fund will focus on are electrification, connectivity, artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. 
With such high ambitions, setting up of Nissan digital hub facility in Kerala will certainly add another feather to the state’s crown, in addition to its developments so far to promote the tech and startup ecosystem of the state.

The theme of World TB Day 2018 – “Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world”- World Tuberculosis Day, observed on 24 March each year, is designed to build public awareness about the global epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) and efforts to eliminate the disease. In 2012, 8.6 million people fell ill with TB, and 1.3 million died from the disease, mostly in the Third World.World TB Day is one of eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with World Health Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Immunization Week, World Malaria Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Hepatitis Day and World AIDS Day About one third of the world’s population is infected with tuberculosis (TB) bacteria. Only a small proportion of those infected will become sick with TB. People with weakened immune systems have a much greater risk of falling ill from TB. A person living with HIV is about 26 to 31 times more likely to develop active TB.One of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 is to end the global TB epidemic.

Congress leader and former Home Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan lashed out at the Pinarayi Vijayan government in the Kerala Assembly on Monday over the unruly behaviour of the state police in various issues across the state. According to Radhakrishnan, the state police have “become a bunch of unruly hooligans and turned rabid”. 
While talking about the topic, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan presented various cases which took place in the state during the last two weeks where the behaviour of the police have been pretty ‘wild and unruly’. “Earlier this month, in Alappuzha, two civilians were killed by a police vehicle when officers were chasing a traffic violator. In another incident, a police officer punched a retired railway official when he had stopped his car for the Kerala Governor to pass through. Then, a video went viral on social media which showed a police officer hurling abuses,” he said.

However, this reply did not go down well with the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala as the opposition decided to walk out from the House “Vijayan appears to have lost control of the police… For the minister to reply, just reading out the version of the police won’t help,” added Chennithala.

Representing the government, Cultural Affairs Minister AK Balan took a dig at the former UDF government by saying,”Yes we know of what has happened and it will take time as some officials are still under the hangover of the Congress-led UDF rule.” The Minister also added that as many as five police officials have received punishments so far and many others will also receive the same for their unruly behaviour. 
However, this reply did not go down well with the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala as the opposition decided to walk out from the House “Vijayan appears to have lost control of the police… For the minister to reply, just reading out the version of the police won’t help,” added Chennithala.

The Keezhattur bypass alignment issue is unlikely to figure at a meeting between Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways, and Shipping Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi this weekend. 
Mr. Vijayan, who will be in New Delhi for three days from March 28 to attend the CPI(M) central committee meeting, is to meet Mr. Gadkari and discuss development projects under the Ministry. 
Official sources said the bypass alignment issue was unlikely to figure at the meeting with Mr. Gadkari as the Chief Minister had stated his stance on the issue. The development of waterways and seaport connectivity would figure at the meeting with the Union Minister. 
The meeting comes in the backdrop of “Vayalkilikal”, a group of residents of Keezhattur spearheading an agitation against the proposed National Highway bypass passing through the paddy fields there, stepping up its protest and a letter from Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran to Mr. Gadkari for an elevated corridor to overcome the agitation. 
Environmental and social activists and political workers belonging to the BJP and other outfits are supporting the local people while the CPI(M) is opposing the stir and supporting the alignment. 
The agitation had acquired political overtones as villagers, mostly CPI(M) workers and sympathisers, began the stir in defiance of the party stance. 
The Vayalkilikal alleged that the bypass project, in the home turf of the Chief Minister, would cause havoc to the environment in the village and destroy the paddy fields. 
The group had also come out against the proposed elevated corridor. 
Already, 3(A) notification had been issued by MoRTH for land acquisition for developing the NH and boundary stones laid by revenue officials.",english

A multi-agency humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) exercise to review the response mechanism in the event of a cyclonic storm will be led by the Southern Naval Command at the BTP Jetty of the Cochin Port from April 5 to 8. 
Named ‘Chakravat’ meaning ‘cyclone’, the exercise will see participation by the three Services, the Coast Guard, State administration, State Disaster Management Authority, National Disaster Response Force, Fisheries Department, Coastal Police, and members of the fishing community. 
It is for the first time that the yearly exercise is being conducted in Kochi, Commodore Deepak Kumar, Chief Staff Officer (Operations), Southern Naval Command, told The Hindu during an interaction. 
While a skills and joint relief and reconstruction demonstration held as part of the exercise will be on the scenario of a cyclone hitting a port, a range of activities such as aerial surveys, rescue and relief missions, port clearance operations, and pollution control undertaken for disaster mitigation will apply to any large-scale disaster along the coast. 
A seminar to be organised as part of the exercise will have the Collectors of Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam – two districts that bore the brunt of Cyclone Ockhi late last year – and Additional Chief Secretary (Disaster Management) talk about disaster relief operations. The perspectives of the Disaster Relief Commissioner of Tamil Nadu and the armed forces will also be presented at the seminar. Janki Andharia, dean of the School of Disaster Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, will offer an academic view of disaster relief operations. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate an exhibition showcasing equipment used for disaster management, and a host of Ministers and top civil servants from the State will be taking part in the seminar, further cementing the robust civil-military relationship in the State, Commodore Kumar said. 
The skill demo will also comprise the setting up of a model disaster relief camp for internally displaced people and a field hospital which will be set up by the Army. A Naval ship, converted into a hospital vessel, will be berthed at the BTP Jetty. 
“A key aspect of the exercise is training in disaster relief ops imparted to citizen volunteers and cadets of the NCC by the State Disaster Management Authority, Directorate of Health Services, and the Fire and Rescue Services. The field hospital, disaster relief camp, and exhibition will be open to public viewing on April 6, 7 and 8,” said Commodore Kumar. 
He added that Cyclone Ockhi was unique on many counts. It defied history, geography and scientific forecast to wreck havoc in a manner that was unprecedented. The Navy fought the odds to send out its vessels and aircraft, but the extreme weather conditions only allowed them to make slow progress. “Internationally, search and rescue operations last 96 hours, but we carried out the operations for 30 days in which search was conducted over 4.5 lakh square miles of the sea,” he said.",english

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has lashed out at the BJP-led government at the Centre for its skewed economic policies that have led to the destruction of public sector units and brought distress to the country’s agrarian sector. 
Speaking after inaugurating a massive rally in connection with the conclusion of the four-day national general council of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) on Kozhikode beach on Monday, he said the anti-people policies being pursued by the Narendra Modi government over the past four years, including the flawed demonetisation drive, had an adverse impact on the economy and had been detrimental to the interests of farmers and the working class. Protests were brewing across all segments of society, be it the farming community, private and government employees or the unorganised working class, he said. 
He said cases of farmer suicides had increased after the BJP-led government assumed power in 2014. No steps had been taken to implement the M.S. Swaminathan Commission Report that advocated the cause of increasing farmer incomes, and livelihood and health security of farm, fishing, tribal, pastoral and agricultural workers. On the other hand, the BJP-ruled States of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan had dealt with farmer protests with bullets. However, the agitation of farmers intensified in Maharashtra as well as in Uttar Pradesh, he said. 
Accusing the BJP of trying to foment communal disturbances, Mr. Vijayan said the party had employed such tactics deliberately to drive a wedge among the workers and the farmers. With its communal agenda, the BJP wanted to divert people’s attention from real issues, he said. 
The Chief Minister said the only alternative to the mischief propagated by the BJP was to bring together the working class, farmers, intellectuals, cultural leaders, rationalists and students. On the economic front, the CPI(M)-led government in Kerala was reviving public sector units and providing succour to traditional industries, he added. 
Referring to Tripura, he said the previous Left government had taken several measures beneficial to the people, including rooting out extremism and separatism. The BJP had gained foothold in the State not because of its own strength, he said. At least 10 MLAs of the Congress party had joined the BJP before the Assembly polls. Nearly 36 candidates of the BJP had contested the earlier elections on the Congress ticket, said Mr. Vijayan.",english

The Kerala opposition slammed the Pinarayi Vijayan government in the Assembly on Monday over “losing control” over the state police as they have “become a bunch of unruly hooligans and turned rabid”. 
Seeking leave for an adjournment motion on this topic, former Home Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan presented cases that took place in the past two weeks involving unruly police officer. 
“Earlier this month, in Alappuzha, two civilians were killed by a police vehicle when officers were chasing a traffic violator. In another incident, a police officer punched a retired railway official when he had stopped his car for the Kerala Governor to pass through. Then, a video went viral on social media which showed a police officer hurling abuses,” said Radhakrishnan. 
He added that Vijayan and the state police chief Loknath Behera were purposely absent from the House proceedings so that Minister for Culture A.K. Balan was saddled with the responsibility for replying on behalf of the government. 
Balan said: “Yes we know of what has happened and it will take time as some officials are still under the hangover of the Congress-led UDF rule. 
“While we have suspended five police officers, it will not end with that… No erring officials will get any protection.” 
Unhappy with the reply, Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala pointed out that the people’s police have now turned to be people’s tormentors. 
“Vijayan appears to have lost control of the police… For the minister to reply, just reading out the version of the police won’t help,” Chennithala said before leading the opposition out of the House. Share this:",english

Kochi: Lack of clarification over new requirement of obtaining a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) or Good Conduct Certificate for employment in the UAE, has left overseas job seekers from the state high and dry. While candidates from most states are using the PCC issued by the Regional Passport Offices (RPO), in Kerala authorities are insisting on PCCs issued by the police. A clarification from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) or UAE government on the new requirement which has been made mandatory from Feb.4 is awaited. Those facing criminal cases would not be issued employment visa. However, the new norm would not apply to other types of visas including tourists.RPOs under the MEA issued PCCs with a fee of Rs500. The UAE consulate in Kerala has been insisting on PCCs issued by the local police for which the candidates have to spend around Rs6,000.So far, PCC was mandatory for jobs only in some countries like Kuwait, USA, UK, Canada and Australia.The PCC, also known as the certificate of good conduct, is issued by the RPOs. The application for PCC needs to be submitted at the Passport Seva Kendras. For fresh passport holders PCCs could be issued without much delay. Holders of renewed passports, however, would have to get police verification report from district police chiefs, before applying for PCCs from passport offices.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to freeze the rule for six months to make the process more convenient to the candidates.Police reduced the application fees and simplified procedures for issuing police clearance certificate to UAE job seekers recently. The fee was slashed from Rs1000 to Rs500. As per the new decision, application is to be submitted in the local police station. The certificate will be issued by the Station House Officer (SHO). SHO should issue the certificate in three days after verification of required documents. The PCC application form can be downloaded from www.keralapolice.org. After obtaining PCCs from the local police, a job aspirant has to get the certificate attested by the state Home Department, External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi and UAE consulate, by paying around Rs6,000.",english

In the process, it also violated two provisions in the ordinance it had promulgated. This flies in the face of the CPM and its youth and student organisations that waged relentless battles for three decades to clean up the higher education sector, especially self-financing professional colleges. The Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, on January 31, 2018 authorised the regularisation of admissions in Kannur Medical College, Anjarakkady, in violation of provisions on capitation fee and profiteering in its own ordinance. It regularised the admissions in Karuna Medical College, Palakkad, also.
The Cabinet which trashed the findings of Mr B. Srinivas, the Competent Authority designated to consider applications for regularisation, also overruled additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Sadanandan who concurred with the Competent Authority. Instead, it relied on a report submitted by law secretary B.G. Harindranath, favouring the regularisation of all the seats, documents accessed by DC through the provisions of the Right to Information Act show. Interestingly, law minister A.K. Balan noted that the reports of the two departments were “not in concurrence with” each other, signifying his disapproval of the law secretary’s report, and left the decision to the Chief Minister, documents show. The CM chose to stand by the law secretary, paving the way for the illegal regularisation of admissions, cancelled by the statutory ASC after finding that the colleges had failed in the triple test of transparency, non-profiteering and merit-based admission, set by the Supreme Court.
The High Court and the Supreme Court had dismissed the petitions filed by the students and managements challenging the committee's decision. As per the ordinance, now being replaced by a Bill which is under the consideration of the Assembly subject committee, a Competent Authority appointed to consider applications for regularisation has to consider six parameters, one of them being to ""ensure that no capitation fee was collected by management."" Mr Srinivas, then principal secretary (health), who was appointed the Competent Authority, sought the opinion of the ASC on this provision. The ASC, in its report, said ""parents of 12 students of 2016-17 MBBS batch of Kannur Medical College filed complaints before this committee for directing the college to return the fee collected from the above students at the time of admission (as those students have decided to join for other colleges). The allegations in the complaint would reveal that the students have paid the amounts shown against their names.""
The committee, which listed names of 12 students who paid between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 45 lakh, concluded that ""it is evident that the college collected fee in excess of the permitted limited which can be construed as capitation. The complaint and other material evidences in this regard are forwarded herewith."" Mr Srinivas, based on this report, said he was unable to ensure that the management collected no capitation fee which was a condition in the ordinance.
""It is evident from the above-mentioned ASC communication and the accompanied evidence that the management of Kannur Medical College, Anjarakkandy, indulged in collection of capitation fee. In the circumstances, it is not possible for the competent authority to ensure compliance of Sections 4 (v) & (vi) of the ordinance,"" says the report Mr Srinivas submitted to the additional chief secretary (health). These sections mandated that the Competent Authority ensure colleges collected no capitation fee nor did not resort to profiteering. The Authority, however, recommended for regularisation the admission of 44 of 137 students of Kannur Medical College and 24 of 31 students of Karuna Medical College after finding that they were denied admission for no fault of theirs. Mr Sadanandan concurred with the recommendations of the Competent Authority.
However, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja sought the opinion of the law department in an apparent bid to overrule the recommendations of the Competent Authority not to regularise the admissions of 93 students of Kannur Medical College and 7 students of Karuna Medical College. The law secretary in his report questioned the report of the Competent Authority, saying the Authority had not understood the provisions in the ordinance properly. He dismissed the findings of the Admission Supervisory Committee that Kannur Medical College had indeed collected capitation fee saying ""there is no material available to conclude that capitation fee was collected or that there is profiteering by the management"". He also listed the 'faults' committed by the Competent Authority and opined that the minister concerned can overrule the opinion of the officials.
Mr Pinarayi Vijayan, concurring with the law secretary, directed Mr Sadanandan to put up a note for the Cabinet to see if the Competent Authority can be authorised to take the decision after ""removing the shortcomings pointed out by the law department."" The Cabinet on January 31, 2018, ""decided to stick with legal opinion of the law secretary and depute the administrative department (health) to approve the list to be prepared and issue orders on the same."" The health department, having, lost its battle, in its order on February 14, regularised the admissions of 118 students of Kannur Medical College and 31 students of Karuna Medical College along with a fine of Rs 3 lakh per student to be paid by the colleges.",english

In a Facebook post, the minister said the edathavalam at Sree Mahadeva Temple premises at Chengannur was one of the projects envisaged by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The minister was reacting to BJP's Facebook post claiming that petroleum ministry had sanctioned Rs 10-crore for halting place at Chengannur Mahadeva temple.
He said the state government had directly and with the cooperation of Kerala regional offices of central PSUs like IOC, BPCL, joined hands for constructing the halting places on 36 temple premises. As part of it, agreement was signed for 10 halting places between Devaswom Boards and IOC officials in the presence of chief minister. As per state government’s decision, Travancore Devaswom Board and BPCL signed an agreement for constructing halting place at Chengannur at a cost of Rs 9.5 core for Sabarimala pilgrims. In return of the construction of halting place, the state government would be giving land to BPCL on lease for 30 years for setting up petrol and diesel pumps.
The state government had issued a GO in connection with halting place on March 23. “In my capacity as Devaswom Board minister, I will be laying the foundation stone for the edathavalam at Sree Mahadeva Temple premises in Chenganuur on March 27,” the minister said. Kadkampally said through this project the government was fulfilling the dream of former Chengannur MLA late K K Ramachandran Nair . Meanwhile, BJP State president Kummanam Rajasekharan reacted sharply to Kadakampally's Facebook post. Kummanam said devaswom minister's words were misleading as it is the Central government which is incurring the expenses towards having the halting places at Chengannur.
He sought to know as to who was responsible in getting Indian Oil Corporation Kerala retail head Naveen Charan to sign an agreement with Travancore Devaswom Board for the construction of halting places. ""As per the written agreement, the expenses towards having the halting places are borne by the IOC.

(Photo: AP) New Delhi: Former Governor of Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan on Friday said the country should enable its workforce to move out of agriculture into industry and services, as income in the latter sectors is much higher.
He said the society has always found ways to adapt to changing times even when there have been fears of machines replacing humans.
""We have to try and give people the ability to move out of agriculture into industry and services, where income is much higher. We need to figure out ways to do this,"" Rajan said here.
""What jobs will humans be able to do in 10-15 years that are immune from threat? Jobs that require high intelligence and creativity; jobs that require human empathy and jobs where human working for us bolster our status in some way,"" he added.
The former RBI Governor in his address outlining the vision for India at #FUTURE Global Digital Summit organised by the Kerala government also expressed fears that Artificial Intelligence would take up jobs - both high skilled and unskilled.
He said that the country needs to embrace technology and become a leader in the digital transformation taking place around the globe.
Rajan also said that India needs to create good jobs because the job statics are not very good in the country.
""We can clearly do well and we should do more, not just for people who are going to enter the labour force, but for the people who are already in it,"" he said.
The Professor, Finance at University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, said India has fewer jobs to lose. ""Many don't have the cushy jobs, which are threatened. But that is an opportunity. Change is happening and the change will threaten job. We need to make people capable of adapting.""
The #FUTURE Global Digital Summit, where hundreds of delegates, entrepreneurs, startup founders and CEOs took part in panel discussions, aimed at paving the way for the digital transformation of Kerala, where internet penetration is highest in the country.
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan while inaugurating the two-day event on Thursday vowed to embrace digital technology as a means of bridging the gap between the rich and the poor.",english

Asserting that IFTAS was a paper company sans own solutions and technical competence, and being projected as an RBI subsidiary to help some private players behind to commit financial fraud, Satheesan told the assembly on Monday that ‘the government is still in negotiations with the company’. Though the project is now being estimated at Rs 60 crore instead of Rs 160 crore (after opposition raised its allegations in the assembly last week), the recurring cost for the next three years will be around Rs 300 crore, he said. In the absence of cooperation minister Kadakampally Surendran, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said the government has not yet issued any order awarding the work to IFTAS or reached any agreement with the company. “The government, through an order, has only constituted a committee with IT secretary as chairman and registrar of cooperative societies as convener to consider the proposal submitted by IFTAS and to hold a discussion with the company on the proposed software’s technical competence, cost, recurring cost and time required for installation,” Isaac said. Unsatisfied with the minister’s reply, Satheesan said the government had been negotiating with IFTAS for the past one year, even after learning that the company doesn’t have an own non-banking module (required for 90% of the primary cooperatives). “The government has not prepared an RFP (request for proposal) or invited EoI (expression of interest) to facilitate competitive tendering. Competence has to be ensured even if the proposal comes directly from the RBI,” the Congress MLA said. Satheesan pointed out that there was also an undue hurry now in awarding the work to IFTAS. “The primary cooperatives will become business kiosks of the proposed Kerala Bank soon, and will have to change their software again. In fact, there’s no need for a change of software or CBS at this juncture,” he added. On the earlier clarification made by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan last week citing an RBI directive recommending IFTAS, Satheesan said the particular directive was for installation of CBS in urban cooperative banks and not for the entire primary cooperative banks.

The State government has decided to declare nine districts as drought-hit. 
The decision to declare Alappuzha, Kannur, Idukki, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur, and Wayanad districts as drought-hit was taken by a meeting of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The meeting directed the State Relief Commissioner to issue the formal notification in this regard. 
The meeting, attended by Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar, Chief Secretary Paul Antony, Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) P.H. Kurien, and KSDMA member secretary Sekhar L. Kuriakose, decided to declare the nine districts drought-hit based on criteria such as rainfall deficit, shortfall in availability of surface water and groundwater and salt influx. 
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there was considerable shortfall in rain in these districts during the northeast monsoon. The IMD had also predicted serious drinking water shortage in these districts. 
Idukki did not have drought-like condition until now. The district was, however, declared drought-hit given the possibility of major water sources drying up, resulting in drinking water shortage. 
Urgent steps would be taken for supply of drinking water in the affected districts. Tankers would be used to supply water kiosks. In the event of sufficient funds not being available with the local government institutions for drinking water supply, funds can be accessed from the State Disaster Response Fund. 
Last month, the SDMA had initiated steps to declare nine districts drought-hit after soaring mercury levels in early summer led to water stress. Palakkad and Kozhikode have already reported daytime temperature higher than 40 degrees Celsius on several days, indicating heatwave conditions. 
The annual summer forecast issued by the India Meteorology Department has predicted that the summer of 2018 will be hotter, with maximum temperatures going up by at least one degree above normal. 
The government has expedited the work on water supply schemes and temporary check-dams to address the drinking water shortage. Restoration of local water sources, construction of rainwater pits and subsurface dykes and establishment of water filling stations for tanker lorries have been stepped up.",english

Kochi: The Kerala godman whose penis was allegedly chopped off by a 23-year-old woman who had accused him of rape got his genitals back through surgery on Tuesday. After changing his statement twice, the self-styled godman – Hari Swami, now claims that some ""bigwigs are working against him"" who were behind his penis chopping.""While I claimed then that I myself did it so as to get away from further trouble, the truth is that the same people whom I helped were behind this act and more than one person did it,"" he said.The 55-year-old, whose genitals were slashed with a knife, said he had been in a lot of pain and had even considered getting his penis removed completely. ""I was finally able to urinate freely,"" he said. In May last year, the 23-year-old woman had in her complaint said that the self-styled godman had been raping her for years and to end her ordeal she had chopped of the godman's genitals. Hari Swami had later said that he himself had committed the act. The girl has told the police that the swami would come to their home to meet her mother and whenever he got the opportunity, he would allegedly rape her. The incident had taken place at the godman's residence when he had tried to force himself on the woman, who had then chopped off his genitals before running out of the house, according to the police. She had then called the cops, who later said that Hari Swami had been abusing the woman for the past six years. The godman had been rushed to the hospital for a plastic surgery to get his penis fixed. However, due to the severe condition, the surgery could not have been performed with immediate results. Following the incident, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had praised the woman calling it ""a courageous and strong act by the woman"".",english

Lawyers who understand International Law -- will vouch that anyone that owns Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency based on the blockchain, is breaking the law.. and will be punished.. 
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY renders the mere possession of a blockchain illegal..it is illegal to participate in a blockchain-based system as soon as it contains CHILD SEX content. 
Anyone that owns Bitcoin is breaking the law.

Any Finance minister or PM who supports Bitcoin is breaking the law-- and will be punished.

IF INDIA HAS TO NIP OUT PAKISTAN AIDED TERRORISM IN KASHMIR , ARTICLE 370 AND 35A MUST GO..

WE DO NOT NEED TO RUN TO ANY COLLEGIUM JUDGE…

WE DO NOT CARE FOR THESE UNCONSTITUTIONAL COLLEGIUM JUDGES..

Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The article is drafted in Part XXI of the Constitution: Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions.

The State's Constituent Assembly was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution to be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether.

After the state Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending abrogation, the Article 370 was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.

THE ELECTIONS TO THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ASSEMBLY IN 1951 WERE RIGGED.

They exploited Article 370, and adopted Sections 6, 8 and 9 for incorporation in the Constitution under which the State was to be governed in the future.

Article 370 gave the solitary State of Jammu & Kashmir the right to have a separate Constitution and separate flag, but nowhere does it say which category of Indians will enjoy all citizenship rights in Jammu & Kashmir and which sections will not.

PARAMOUNT CLAUSE: "" ETHNIC CLEANSING "" - OF SIX LAKHS KASHMIRI PANDITS BY KASHMIRI MUSLIMS SUPPORTED BY PAKISTAN, MAKES ARTICLE 370 NULL AND VOID…

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/09/uniform-civil-code-in-india-capt-ajit.html 

Jawaharlal Nehru, the HALF BROTHER of Sheikh Abdullah (who married the wife of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-- JEWESS BEGUM AKBAR JEHAN) subverted the basic structure of the Indian Constitution in May 1954 to deprive all Indian citizens, including refugees from West Pakistan settled in Jammu province. of their fundamental right to exercise all rights in Jammu & Kashmir…

Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah made sure that the Permanent Residents of Jammu & Kashmir shall exercise all rights all over India…

Nehru amended Article 368 without taking the Indian Parliament into confidence, THOUGH Parliament alone had the power to amend or not amend the Constitution, to amend Article 35 and add to it the atrocious Article 35A which was enforced in Jammu & Kashmir through the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, May 1954.

Article 35A enabled the Jammu & Kashmir Constituent Assembly to deny citizenship rights to the HINDU refugees from West Pakistan and all other Indians, barring Permanent Residents of the State.

Armed with absolute power, the Jammu & Kashmir Constituent Assembly adopted Section 6 which said no persons who had crossed over to the state after May 1944 will be considered eligible for citizenship rights.

Nehru enforced Article 35A in Jammu & Kashmir UNCONSTITUTIONALLY - More important he criminally CONCEALED it.

He hid the amendments from the public, by not mentioning the same in the main body of the Constitution—read this line twice.

The unconstitutional amendments to Article 368 and Article 35 were mentioned only in Appendix-I and Appendix-II, respectively, so that they could escape public attention in a CRIMINAL MANNER.

AN APPENDIX CAN NEVER HIJACK THE MAIN BODY OF ANY ARTICLE.

ANY IDIOT KNOWS THIS UNLESS HE IS SENILE.

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 2:57 PM CONTINUED FROM 1-

Nehru in cahoots with his HALF BROTHER Sheikh Abdullah conspired against the HINDU refugees from West Pakistan, and then further hatched a conspiracy against all Indian citizens, in order to pander to communalists in Kashmir, by subverting Articles 16 and 19 of the Indian Constitution which deal with the rights of Indian citizens, including fundamental rights.

Article 19, for example, says that “All citizens shall have the right (a) to freedom of speech and expression, (b) to assemble peacefully and without arms, (c) to form associations or unions, (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India, (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business”.

It follows that what is needed is not just the abrogation of Article 370 but also the revocation of Article 35A. This is the only course left to enable the refugees from West Pakistan and other Indians to exercise citizenship rights in Jammu & Kashmir and integrate it fully into India.

In October 2015, the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir has ruled that the Article 370 cannot be ""abrogated, repealed or even amended.""

It explained that the clause (3) of the Article conferred power to the State's Constituent Assembly to recommend to the President on the matter of the repeal of the Article.

Since the Constituent Assembly did not make such a recommendation before its dissolution in 1957, the Article 370 has taken on the features of a ""permanent provision"" despite being titled a temporary provision in the Constitution.

BALLS !

WHAT IS DONE BY DECEIT IS "" NULL AND VOID ""..

Article 35A came into existence by a Presidential Order passed by Dr. Rajandra Prasad ( Rothschild sponsored FAKE Kayastha ) on the advice of Nehru’s cabinet in 1954...

President of India has sole legislative power under article 123 power to make ordinance when either house of the Parliament is not in session.

- This legislative powers of the President has an EXPIRY SHELL PERIOD OF MERE SIX MONTHS....

The Constitution can be amended only by the Parliament as per procedure clearly laid out in Article 368. but Article 35A was never presented before the Parliament of India…

This effectively means, in this case, the President bypassed the amending procedure as laid out in the Constitution of India in order to add the new Article 35A…

This also means that Article 368 of the Constitution, in its application to Jammu and Kashmir, also got amended!..

The President of India does not have legislative power, but here in this case he performed the function of Parliament!..

Article 35A appears in the Constitution as an appendix…How can an Article, which has been implemented on the ground as if it’s a part of the Constitution, be missing from the text of the Constitution ?

Article 35A was an amendment in our Constitution via the back door (Presidential order), without the involvement of India’s Parliament…

Article 35A is an example of the abuse of Article 370. Article 35A is a violation of the basic structure of our Constitution. Article 35A spawned a set of laws that were discriminatory in nature. ..

It curbs certain basic rights enshrined in the very Preamble of the Constitution. A Kashmiri woman marrying a non-permanent resident or outsider loses all succession rights, while a Kashmiri man does not.

As a result of the implementation of Article 35A,.lakhs of Indian HINDU citizens have been deprived of “ JUSTICE, social, economic and political ” and “ EQUALITY of status and of opportunity ”...

In the laws under Article 370 read with Article 35A even the President of India may be denied a place or land for official purpose. This is a breach of trust…

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 2:58 PM CONTINUED FROM 2--

Democratic India cannot allow any section of its population to be treated as second-rate citizens in any part of the country.

Article 368 is the only way to amend the Constitution,.. Not the President.

The marginal note of Article 368 states; “ Power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and procedure, therefore ”.. Which means it is the Parliament that has the power to amend the Constitution.

Sub-clause 2 of the Article 368 states that: --
“ An amendment of this Constitution may be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament, and when the Bill is passed in each House by majority of not less than two-third of the members of that House present and voting, [it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon] the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of Bill...""

The President of India does NOT have the sole UNBRIDLED power to amend the constitution through the bypass of the entire Constitutional mechanism nor does Article 370 give power to the President to insert any Article in any Part of the Constitution....

The parliamentary route of lawmaking was bypassed when the President incorporated Article 35A into the Constitution. Article 368 (i) of the Constitution empowers only Parliament to amend the Constitution. The President acted outside his jurisdiction.. Article 35A is void because the Nehru government did not place it before Parliament for discussion..

Article 370 grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A empowers the state legislature to define permanent citizens.

Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian Constitution are an ""unnecessary baggage"" of the past and hence these laws be repealed..

Restricting citizens from other States from getting employment or buying property within Jammu and Kashmir is a violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution…

Article 370 (along with Article 35A) is an anachronistic decree that has outlived its utility, militates against India’s sovereignty, and discriminates against both Indians and Kashmiris by mutually excluding each other from syncretic growth. It is redundant, and constitutionally discarded into the dustbin of history.

THE TERM "" SUBJUDIDE "" DOES NOT APPLY TO INDIA.. AS WE DON’T HAVE A JURY SYSTEM..

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 11:32 PM SOMEONE ASKED ME--

WHY DO YOU SAY THE DEEP STATE APPOINTS I&B MINISTERS IN MOST NATIONS..

OK CHECK THIS OUT ?

EVER HEARD OF PRISM ? 

PRISM is a tool used by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to collect private electronic data belonging to users of major internet services like Facebook

National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the US Director of National Intelligence. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine.

PRISM began in 2007..

Its existence was leaked six years later by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as ""dangerous"" and ""criminal"" activities""

NSA has ""direct access"" to the servers of Google, Facebook, and others

PRISM’s existence was leaked by Edward Snowden before he entered into ongoing asylum in Moscow. Microsoft was the first company to join the PRISM program.

The then Minister of External Affairs Salman Khurshid ( of a particular DNA same as ex-President Zakir Hussain ) defended the PRISM program saying, ""This is not scrutiny and access to actual messages"". It is only computer analysis of patterns of calls and emails that are being sent. It is not actually snooping specifically on content of anybody's message or conversation. Some of the information they got out of their scrutiny, they were able to use it to prevent serious terrorist attacks in several countries.""

Khurshid baby's comments contradicted his Foreign Ministry's characterization of violations of privacy as ""unacceptable.""

We know why Modi chose some of his I&B ministers- my lips are sealed as of now.

THIS STUNT BY MUSLIMS TO PLAY AORUND WITH BABRI MASJID CASE WILL NOT BEAR FRUIT.

IMPEACHING CJI IS NOT EASY AT ALL.

There had to be an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session.

First and foremost, under Art 124, a Notice of motion, may be given by 100 members of Lok Sabha or 50 members of Rajya Sabha. Then, the Speaker or the chairman may refuse or accept the motion.

IN THIS CASE WE THE PEOPLE EXPECT THE SPEAKER TO REJECT IT OUTRIGHT !

Unless both the houses approach the president, the president CANNOT remove the judge under Art 124(4).    As of now this is IMPOSSIBLE unless the sun rises in the west and the crow files upside down or Rahul Gandhi the donkey metamorphoses to a race horse

ALL POLITICIANS WHO ARE CRIMINALLY TRYING TO IMPEACH THE CJI MUST BE PROFILED AND PUNISHED

Irish Potato blight was caused by Fungus Phytophthora infestans imported by Rothschild from America

Carbonate–silicate cycle plays a large part in the carbon cycle, since the equilibrium point of the carbonate-silicate cycle dictates the pace of carbon release from the lithosphere Roshan Raghunathan March 28, 2018 at 5:43 PM Capt, how does the static electricity that you mentioned work on a cricket ball both when it is old and new? Players have surreptitiously used saliva sweetened by chewing gum, vaseline and hair gels to maintain the shine on one side of the ball and other abrasive objects like bottle caps, zippers, sandpaper on the other side to induce reverse swing on a softer, older ball. The australians got caught now but to be honest, every team probably does it to some extent which explains very often why the ball starts reversing around the 30th and 40th over in test matches itself where ptherwise it probably might not until much later. It is certain that the Australians have been doing things to the ball for some time now and it was only a commentator who told the cameraman to keep an eye on them that enabled them to be caught red-handed now. Would appreciate it if you shed more light on this.

When Tamang proceeded to the SMS-voting rounds, people of the hills made sure they left no stone unturned to keep Tamang in the contest…

GURUNG BABY THEN CONVERTED THESE SMS VOTE/ MISSED CALL PEOPLE INTO HIS FOLLOWERS BY BRAINWASHING THEM ..-- WITH FOREIGN FUNDED NGO SUPPORT ...

Bimal Gurung, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief, who was then working with Subhash Ghising in the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), raised huge amounts of money and created polling booths to finance a mass SMS campaign..

THE CUNT IS MAKING ROCKET SCIENCE OUT OF SIMPLE ASTROLOGY

Easter, also called Resurrection Day is a Christian holiday celebrating Jesus Christ returning from the dead.

Easter is not held on the same date every year. This is called a moveable feast. Western churches, like the Roman Catholic Church, use the Gregorian calendar, while Eastern churches, like the Eastern Orthodox Church, use the Julian calendar. In 2015 Easter was celebrated on April 5 for both the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar. Jesus Christ never existed—but was cooked up by Roman Emperor Constntine the Great at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD, which included an astronomer sage from Kerala  
http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2017/12/the-rotating-statue-on-nemi-ship-on.html 

HE STUPID “POPE TO BE”WANTED EASTER TO BE THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER THE FULL MOON AFTER THE VERNAL EQUINOX. 

Vishu is the second biggest festival in Kerala and it ushers in the Malayalam new year

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the vernal equinox on or close to March 21, so that the date of Easter is celebrated on the Sunday after the full moon.. Read this line TWICE.

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/09/sanatana-dharma-hinduism-exhumed-and_17.html 

EASTER IS CELEBRATED BY CHRISTIANS BETWEEN LAST WEEK MARCH TO LAST WEEK APRIL. 
THIS YEAR FOR WESTERN CHURCH IT IS APRIL 1ST AND FOR EASTERN CHURCH ARRIL 8TH
In 1818 the Paschal Full Moon fell on Saturday March 21 (the equinox). Therefore, the following day, March 22, was Easter. It will not fall as early again until 2285, a span of 467 years. The next earliest Easter between 1818 and 2285 (March 23) occurred in 1845, 1856, 1913 and 2008, and will occur again in 2160--a 11, 57, 95 and 152-year gap, respectively.

The earliest dates for Easter in the Eastern Orthodox Church between 1875 and 2099 are, 22 March 1915 and 22 March 2010. Both dates are equivalent to April 4 in the Gregorian Calendar.

Despite using calendars that are apart by 13 days, Easter 2014 fell on the same date. According to the Western (Gregorian) calendar, the first Paschal Full Moon after the Spring Equinox (March 20) fell on Monday, April 14, 2014. The following Sunday, April 20, was, therefore, Easter Day.

The Gregorian Calendar was created so that annual astronomical events, specifically the vernal equinox (used to determine when Easter is), would on average keep their places in the calendar year over time.

There are two ways of finding how long it takes the sun to complete its apparent revolution in the heavens, or, in other words, how long it takes the earth to make a complete revolution around it.

One of these consists in observing the exact time at which the sun reaches the equinoxes. In ancient times astronomical observers were able to do this by noting the days when the sun rose exactly in the east or set exactly in the west. By observing the rising and setting from day to day, they could find not only the day, but almost the hour in which the sun was on the celestial equator

The period between two returns of the sun to the same equinox is called the solar year or equinoxial year. The other way of finding the length of the year consists in observing the interval of time between two passages of the sun past the same star in the heavens; for example, the period between two of its passages past one of the stars

The ancient Kerala astronomers got the same result by using the moon as an intermediate object to measure from. The moon could be seen before sunset and its distance from the sun determined. Then, when the star appeared after sunset, the distance from the star to the moon was measured.

Allowing for the motion of the moon during the interval, the apparent distance between the sun and the star could thus be learned from day to day. In this way it could be found how many days it was between the times at which the sun was at the same distance from any given bright star.

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 30, 2018 at 2:22 PM CONTINUED FROM 1--

This would be the period of apparent revolution of the sun in the celestial sphere, or, as we now know it to be, the period of one revolution of the earth in its orbit. This period is called the sidereal year, because it is fixed by the stars.

BOTH HIPPARCHUS AND. PTOLEMY LEARNT IN THE KONDUNGALLUR UNIVERSITY OWNED BY THE CALICUT KING ( MY HOMETOWN )

With our exact modern observations we have found the lengths of the years to be:--

Solar year/ 365 d. 5 h. 48 m. 46 s.
Sidereal year/ 365 d 6 h 9 m 9 s
Difference/ 20 m. 23 s.

This difference shows that the position of the equinoxes among the stars is changing from year to year-- nearly one degree in 70 years.

The tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the extreme north and south latitudes where the Sun can appear directly overhead. Because the vernal equinox moves back along the ecliptic due to precession, a tropical year is shorter than a sidereal year (in 2000, the difference was 20 m 23 s

The number of mean solar days in a vernal equinox year has been oscillating between 365.2424 and 365.2423 for several millennia and will likely remain near 365.2424 for a few more. This long-term stability is pure chance, because in our era the slowdown of the rotation, the acceleration of the mean orbital motion, and the effect at the vernal equinox of rotation and shape changes in the Earth's orbit, happen to almost cancel out.

Earth's pole aligns with different pole stars throughout its precessional period. Polaris is Earth's current north-pole star. Earth's 25675 -year precessional cycle is also referred to as ""Earth's Great Year.""

THE POINT WHERE EQUINOCTIAL ( CELESTIAL EQUATOR ) CUTS THE ECLIPTIC WAS CALLED ""THE FIRST POINT OF ARIES "" BY KERALA ASTRONOMERS DURING THE PERIOD 2500 BC , WHEN ANCIENT GREEKS KNEW SHIT ABOUT ASTRONOMY . THE STAR IS MEDAM ( HAMAL )

IN 1 AD , THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF EQUINOCTIAL AND ECLIPTIC CHANGED TO PISCES ( MEENAM IN MALAYALAM AND SANSKRIT ) AND THIS WILL REMAIN SO TILL 2150 AD

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2016/04/apollonius-or-jesus-christ-who-is-real.html 

THE WHITE CHRISTIAN DOES NOT HAVE THE CEREBRAL WHEREWITHAL TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS. 

THIS SKELETON WAS PROVIDED FOR THE BIBLE BECAUSE ALL HINDUS GODS WERE COSMIC ALLEGORIES ( EXCEPT VISHNU AVATARS) 

ONE KERALA SAGE ATTENDED THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA IN 325 AD, CALLED BY THE ROMAN EMPEROR CONSTANTIN THE GREAT --WHERE HE WARNED THE EMPEROR NOT TO ALLOW THE STUPID POPE TO THROW THE SPANNER IN THE WORKS (FOR EASTER) AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE ACCURATE SIDEREAL SYSTEM. 

AFTER ALL THE COUNCIL WAS CALLED TO DELETE THE EXISTENCE OF KERALA SAGE APOLLONIUS OF TYANA--WHO WAS CONSIDERED GOD BY ROMANS 

The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth's equator. In other words, it is a projection of the terrestrial equator out into space. As a result of the Earth's axial tilt, the celestial equator is inclined by 23.4° with respect to the ecliptic plane. 

The ecliptic is an imaginary line on the sky that marks the annual path of the sun. It is the projection of Earth’s orbit onto the celestial sphere. 

THE FIRST POINT OF ARIES ( VERNAL EQUINOX --SUN PASSAGE SOUTH TO NORTH ON ECLIPTIC) CORRESPONDS WITH THE GREENWICH MERIDIAN ON PLANET EARTH AND SO LONGITUDE IS DERIVED FROM THIS AFTER A CELESTIAL SIGHT USING SEXTANT 

180 DEGREES OPPOSITE IS THE ""FIRST POINT OF LIBRA"" ( AUTUMNAL EQUINOX --SUN PASSAGE NORTH TO SOUTH ON ECLIPTIC ) WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE. AGAIN THIS POINT IS NO LONGER IN LIBRA , BUT IN VIRGO DUE TO PRECESSION

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil 
November 29, 2017 at 7:44 PM 

On the vernal (spring) and autumnal (fall) equinoxes, day and night are nearly the same length ... 

An equinox is regarded as the moment in which the plane of Earth's equator passes through the center of the Sun's disk, which occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September. 

WHY IS VISHU CELEBRATED ONLY IN KERALA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS ---BECAUSE THOSE DAYS ONLY KERALA SAGES KNEW ASTRONOMY . 

VEDIC KNOWLEDGE MEANS KERALA DANAVA KNOWLEDGE . 

THE WHITE INVADER CALLED HINDUS SUPERSTITIOUS SAVAGES BECAUSE WE CELEBRATED VISHU ..

Besides define the path of the sun, the ecliptic marks the line along which eclipses occur, the moon and planets and asteroids wander, the Zodiac constellations live.

2.2 LAKH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STARVED TO DEATH-- JUST CEAUSE THEY HAVE ADOPTED ISLAMIC FAITH

ALL THE CRYPTO JEW MULLAHS ARE SILENT

WE ASK--WHY IS ZAKIR NAIL SILENT? IS HE THE SLAVE OF THE JEWISH AL SAUD RULING CLAN OF SAUDI ARABIA ?

BOTH UN AND WHO HAS IGNORED THE CHOLERA / DIPHTHERIA EPIDEMIC SPREADING LIKE WILD FIRE IN YEMEN..

MODI WHO LOVES TO HUG WHITE JEWS HAS SNUFFED OUT BHARATMATAs MORAL VOICE ON THIS PLANET..

The Saudi-led coalition’s bombardment and blockade of the country, with the full support of the US , UK, EU and NATO has destroyed over 71 % of Yemen's healthcare infrastructure.. Will they ever d this to a Jewish or Christian nation ?

Almost the entire nation is cut off from clean water when the Saudi-led coalition blocked all fuel imports forcing pumping stations to close.

And since the death of former MUSLIM President Ali Abdullah Saleh on 4th December 2017, the air campaign has been stepped up, with massacres occurring on a near-daily basis.

The current president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who took office on 27 February 2012 is a CRYPTO JEW . He was placed on the throne by white JEWS . He was the only candidate in the 2012 election..

President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed by JEWS and not by Islamic Houthi snipers.

Before --on 3 June 2011, Saleh was injured in a KOSHER bomb attack on his presidential compound..The explosion killed four bodyguards and injured the prime minister, deputy prime ministers, head of the Parliament, governor of Sanaa and many more..

Saleh suffered a collapsed lung and burns on about 43 percent of his body.

LIKE GADDAFI , SALEH WAS GIVEN A BAD NAME.. GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME AND KILL IT

According to the BILDERBERG CONTROLLED UN Sanctions Panel by 2012 Saleh has amassed fortune worth in excess of 60 billion USD making him one of the richest people in the world. This is a terrific LIE.

62.000 Yemeni children have died in 2017 alone as a result of disease and starvation.

THE BENAMI INDIA MEDIA IS GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES--BY NOT REPORTING ON YEMEN AT ALL. THE SAME MEDIA WAS GIVING US DOLLOPS ON WHY HILLARY CLINTON , THE MOST EVIL WOMAN IN USA SHOULD BE POTUS.

WE KNOW THE CRYPTO JEW WHITE RULERS WHO KEEP SELLING BOMBS AND MISSILES TO KOSHER AL SAUD BLOODLINE RULED SAUDI ARABIA..

The free denizens of this planet SPIT on this foul kosher propaganda of “Iran is behind it” ..

Hundreds of white journalists is still writing that Saudi Arabia launched a war to restore democracy in Yeman --what a travesty of Justice and Truth ! The bullshit articles never fail to mention that Yemen is emerging from decades of dictatorship under Ali Abdullah Saleh.

They said the same for HERO Gaddafi who deposed JEWISH King Idris.

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2011/10/ethnic-cleansing-of-blackskinned-people.html 

A FARCE election in which JEW Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi ran as the only candidate. You see , he is the legitimate president to be restored, but the KOSHER white media never mention that he had been vice-dictator for 20 years. One election with no other candidates and voila, you get all the stamps you need from the immoral western press..

CHOLERA WAS EXTERMINATED ON THIS PLANET... AT SEA WE SAILORS STOPPED TAKING CHOLERA SHOTS.. THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN YEMEN IS GERM WAR FARE TO KILL YEMENI MUSLIMS..

On Feb. 26 2018, Britain proposed a resolution in the U.N. Security Council blaming Iran for supporting so-called “terror activities” in Yemen.

Although the measure did not pass due to a veto from Russia ( THANK GOD FOR PUTIN ) , 11 out of 15 members supported its content. China and Kazakhstan abstained while Bolivia voted against the resolution.

If passed, this resolution could open the door to a NATO-led war against Iran.Of course Israel and Saudi Arabia will provide the funds. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley backed up this possibility, threatening “unilateral action” against the Islamic Republic.

“If Russia is going to continue to cover for Iran, then the U.S. and our partners need to take action on our own. If we’re not going to get action on the council, then we have to take our own actions,” MS THIN UPPER LIP Nikki Haley told reporters.

Shockingly the Security Council did not address Saudi Arabia’s war crimes and genocidal actions in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes and ground operations have killed and injured more than 43,000 Yemeni people in the past three years.

U.S. forces provide intelligence support for selecting airstrike targets. Riyadh’s airstrike campaign frequently targets markets, homes, cars, media crews, farms, factories, prisons and even ambulance crews entering bomb sites.

U.S. Navy ships enforce the siege and blockade throughout the Red Sea by prohibiting aid and cargo ships from docking in resistance-held territory, such as the Hodeidah port, where Saudi airstrikes destroyed the port’s cranes.

In May 2017, Trump visited the kingdom, signing a record $350 billion arms deal, the largest in US history.

.. rajusundar March 31, 2018 at 1:02 PM captain i had asked you once some years ago. angkor watt temple depicts palazhimadhanam which is in no way connected to buddha but has to do with ayyappa. is this also an ayyappa temple???? was fake buddha superimposed over ayyappa in these south east asian temples?? the local people of vietnam, thailand etc seems to be totally unaware of their own history. 
Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 31, 2018 at 1:33 PM ALL OVER THE PLANET WHITE JEWS HAVE REPLACED AYYAPPA WITH BUDDHA AS THE NINTH AVATAR OF VISHNU

BUDDHISM WAS DEAD IN INDIA .. BUDDHISM WAS REVIVED TO MAKE THE HINDU SELF LOATHING 
FOUL LIES WERE CREATED ..BY JEW ROTHSCHILD..

WE IN INDIA NEVER HEARD OE EMPEROR ASHOKA BEFORE THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA..   SEE THIS EMPEROR CONVERTED FROM B D HINDUSIM TO G D BUDDHSIM..

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2014/08/chanakya-taxila-university-professor.html 
IN THE MOST ANCIENT VISHNU TEMPLES-- ROTHSCHILD EMPLOYED SCULPTORS TO CHIP AWAY AYYAPPA AND INSERT BUDDHA 
BUDDHA WAS A MERE MORTAL WHO STRUGGLED FOR SALVATION.

LORD AYYAPPAs SCULTURES EXISTED IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA -- DEPICTED IN VIMANAS IN ADDITION TO MAYA DANAVA..

THE MAYAN RACE IS CHRISTENED AFTER MAYA DANAVA..

AZTEC-- IS SHAKTI WITH 8 ARMS (ASHTA MEANS 8 IN MALAYALAM AND SANSKRIT )

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2012/07/maya-inca-aztec-civilizations-decoded.html 

MY PERUVIAN OFFICERS HAVE SHOWN ME INCA HINDU TEMPLE RUINS

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tqanJ3DVbM 

IF YOU GO TO SABARIMALA , INSIDE THE SANCTUM SANCTORUM THEY SHOW AYYAPPA WITH A VIMANA CONTROL BELT AROUND HIS KNEES. SAME IS SHOWN IN INCA/ AZTEC/ MAYAN TEMPLES.

ALL ANCIENT RUINS HAVE A DIVINE MATH CONNECTION ..

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2011/11/flight-of-vedic-vimana-capt-ajit.html 

THE HINDU TEMPLES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLDER THAN WHAT WAS DATED BY THE WHITE JEWS 
THE REASON IS --I KNOW ASTRONOMY-- I STUDIED IT FOR MY SHIP CAPTAIN PROFESSION.. I WAS A CAPTAIN IN THE ERA WHERE THERE WAS NO GPS...

TODAY WE HAVE POLESTAR --ANCIENT DAYS WE HAD THUBAN 
When the pyramids were built, the star closest to the pole was Thuban, in Sisumara constellation ( Draco ). Our 7000 year old Vedic texts declare that devout people who know the 14 stars of Sisumara constellation are blessed.

.. Capt. Ajit Vadakayil April 1, 2018 at 12:12 PM THE ITALIAN WAITRESS WAS MOANING AT THE INDIA TODAY CONCLAVE 2018--THAT HINDUS ARE RE-WRITING HISTORY.. CRY CRY --MOAN MOAN--

OBVIOUSLY SHE IS REFERRING TO THIS BLOGSITE -WHERE I WROTE THAT ANCIENT ROMAN HISTORY IS 100% INDIAN HINDU HISTORY

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2017/12/the-rotating-statue-on-nemi-ship-on.html 

MADAME -- I HAVE NOT EVEN WRITTEN 5% ABOUT ANCIENT ROMAN GLORY--WHICH IS HINDU GLORY

95% IS BALANCE

SOMEBODY ASKED ME--

HOW ARE YOU SO SURE THAT THE NEMI SHIPS WERE BUILT IN CALICUT ( BEYPORE SHIPYARD )

THE REASON IS WE BUILT SUCH SHIPS THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THESE NEMI SHIP AND THE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING IS THE SHAME

EXAMPLE?

WELL I WILL MENTION AN UNWRITTEN ONE

WE LINED OUR WOODEN SHIPS AT THE BOTTOM WITH LEAD..

WHY LEAD?

ONLY FOR INLAND SHIPS NAVIGATION ON FRESH WATER -- IF YOU DONT LINE IT WITH LEAD , THE MOLUSSCA WOULD BORE INTO THE UNDERWATER WOODEN HULL AND REDUCE THE LIFE OF THE SHIP

SHIPS WHICH WENT INTO OCEAN SALT WATER -HAD SACRIFICIAL ZINC ANODES PROTECTING IRON PARTS OF THE SHIP--INCLUDING THE ANCHOR

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uru_(boat) 
THE CALICUT PORT OFFICER IS IN CHARGE OF BEYPORE ..

ONE DAY I WILL WRITE ABOUT BRITISH COLLECTOR HENRY VALENTINE CONOLLY -OF CALICUT

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Valentine_Conolly CONOLLY IS CREDITED FOR PLANTING THE NILAMBUR TEAK PLANTATION- WE ARE TAUGHT THIS IN SCHOOL-- TO BE GRATEFUL .   THE GUY WHO GOT HIM KILLED WAS A  FAKE JEW SAYYID  IMPORTED BY JEW ROTHSCHILD..   
THE FATHER SAYYID SON DUO ARE HEROES FOR NORTH KERALA MUSLIMS.. MAMBARAM IS A MAJOR PILGRIMAGE CENTRE

ROTHSCHILD MAKE THE SAYYID SON , THE KING OF DHOFAR ( SOUTH COASTAL BELT OF OMAN --NORTH COASTAL BELT OF YEMEN ) .. THE KING OF CALICUT OWNED DHOFAR..

THE CALICUT KING CHERAMAN PERUMAL WHO MET MOHAMMAD IS BURIED AT SALALAH OMAN. I HAVE VISITED THE GRAVE ..

BALLS ---YOU LYING WHITE HISTORIANS ..

TEAK TREES DONT GROW OVERNIGHT--IT TAKES CENTURIES FOR A TEAK TREE TO AGE AND MATURE FOR SHIP BUILDING WOOD.

BEYPORE HAS BEEN RECEIVING TEAK WOOD FOR MILINNIUMS FROM NILAMBUR --WHEN THE WHITE MAN WAS DOING GRUNT GRUNT FOR LANGUAGE

THE PEOPLE WHO FLOATED THE WOODEN LOGS FROM NILAMBUR TO BEYORE WERE CALLED MARAKKARS ( WOOD PEOPLE )--MARAM MEANS WOOD.

THE CALICUT KINGs ADMIRALS WERE CALLED MARAKKAR ( FROM THIS ANCIENT CLAN )

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunhali_Marakkar 

JEW ROTHSCHILD TRIED TO MAKE THE LAST MUSLIM MARAKKAR NO 4 TO TAKE OVER AS KING OF CALICUT BY DECEIT ( COUP ) ..

THE CALICUT KING FUCKED HIM WHEN MARAKKAR BABY NO 4 , GOT TOO BIG FOR HIS BOOTS.

HE CUT OFF THE TAIL OF THE KINGs ELEPHANT AND CUT OFF THE EARS OF THE KINGs EMISSARY WHO WENT TO HIM TO ARRANGE A MEETING .

AND CONOLLY DID NOT BUILD ANY CANAL--HE JUST DEEPENED A CANAL WHICH EXISTED FOR MILLINIUMS FROM BEYPORE TO CALICUT

BEYPORE BUILD SHIPS FOR KING SOLOMON 2950 YEARS AGO WITH INNDER FITTINGS OF SANDAL WOOD. KING SOLOMON HAD MARRIED QUEEN OF SHEBA --SHEBA IS THE NAME FOR MALABAR ( PUNT/ OPHIR / NORTH KERALA )

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2017/05/land-of-punt-ophir-and-sheba-is-north.html 

THE ROMAN CIVILIZATION DIED BECAUSE THE CHRISTIAN CUNTS USED LEAD TO LINE THE FRESH WATER AQUEDUCTS --WHICH BROUGHT WATER TO ROME..

THE VANDALS / VISIGOTHS INVITED BY POPE TO SACK HIS OWN BASTION ROME ( TO DESTROY HINDU TEMPLES ) --IN FACT DID A FAVOUR IN DISGUISE ..

TO KILL ROME AS A CITY , THE VANDALS / VISIGOTHS ( CANNIBALS PAID IN PEPPER ) CUT OF FRESH WATER SUPPLY BY DAMAGING CRITICAL PARTS OF THE AQUEDUCTS ..

IF THEY HAD NOT DONE IT-- PROBABLY ITALIANS WOULD LOOK LIKE CUNTS TODAY --WITH LEAD POISON DAMAGED DNA..

POOR ITALIAN WAITRESS AND HER HALF BREED CHILDREN -- THEY KNOW SHIT !

90% OF ROTHSCHILD SOLDIERS WERE NON-BRITISH --THIS INCLUDED INDIANS..

THE WHITE BRITISH SOLDIER WAS A STUPID COWARD WHO NEVER LIKED TO SPILL HIS BLOOD AND ENGAGE IN TRENCH WARFARE WITH SWORDS..

ALL PUTIN NEEDS TO CONVERT BRITAIN INTO RADIOACTIVE WASTELAND IS JUST ONE UNSTOPPABLE SARMAT 2 NUCLEAR MISSILE.. JEWESS TERESA MAY MUST KNOW THIS..

https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/29/pope-francis-reportedly-claims-there-no-hell/ 



Capt. Ajit Vadakayil April 1, 2018 at 9:02 PM THE POPE IS ALARMED

NOBODY ATTENDS CHURCH EVEN ON CHRISTMAS EVE-- EXCEPT IN KERALA AND PHILIPPINES

CHRISTIANS ARE NOT AMUSED --BEING BRANDED AS SINNERS-- WITH MESSIAH JESUS WAITING TO SAVE THEM AT PURGATORY.

THEY WANT OUT.

CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL WARNS THE POPE --ALLOW CLERGY TO MARRY

IN SANATANA DHARMA ONLY MARRIED MEN ARE ALLOWED TO BE PUJARIS IN TEMPLES --NOT EVEN WIDOWERS..

JEW ROTHSCHILD CHANGES ALL THAT --

HE CREATED THIS SPECIAL BREED CALLED BRAHMACHARIS -- ALL ANAL SEX RECEIVING GAYS-- AND THESE PERVERTS MANNED OUR TEMPLES-

NOT ANY MORE !

SANATANA DHARMA WANTS MAN AND WOMAN TO MARRY AND PROCREATE. SANATANA DHARMA DOES NOT ALLOW MAN TO REMAIN SINGLE AND CALL HIMSELF A BRAHMACHARI.

AS PER OUR VEDAS NO UNMARRIED MAN CAN CONDUCT A YAGNA.

When faith is placed upon a wrong personality, ( a homosexual EVIL brahmachari rascal in saffron robes ) it can lead to disastrous consequences.

But when it is placed on the true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare.

JEW ROTHSCHILD INTRODUCED ""BRAHMACHARYA "" (CELIBACY ) AND WE HAVE HIS AGENT ROGUES LIKE VIVEKANANDA MAKING A VIRTUE OUT OF IT..

Brahmacharya has nothing to do with withholding semen. The celibate transforms the energy of reproduction into spiritual energy (ojas), bringing in lustre.

The word ‘virya’ mentioned means power of knowledge or action, vigor in body’s organs and the mind, spiritual power or the attainment of siddhis.

Brahmacharya is about allocation: using your resources effectively to achieve your aspiration.Brahmacharya means not misusing sex. Brahmacharya means ‘to respect the creative power of sex and not abuse it by manipulating others sexually.

The sex you have with your wife is LOVE. The sex you have with a whore is LUST.

Like the other yamas, brahmacharya has to do with balance, and how we choose to use or “invest” our resources. Each and every act and thought is an outflow of energy.

Brahmacharya is about harnessing the energy or power of our senses and directing that instead to greater personal understanding- not withholding semen.

WE ARE DONE WITH HOMOSEXUALITY SPREADING GURUS LIKE SRI SRI RAVISHANKAR AND SADGURU JAGGI VASUDEV..

ROTHSCHILD USED GANDHI TO SPEAD HIS BRAHMACHARI NONSENSE-- ALL THE WHILE GANDHI WAS SLEEPING NAKED WITH UNDERAGE GIRLS.

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2017/01/mahatma-gandhi-and-his-endless.html 

The technical meaning of Brahmacharya is self-restraint, particularly mastery of perfect control over the senses- not the PRICK or DICK or LODA alone.

Brahmacharya is the virtue of celibacy when unmarried and fidelity when married..

Brahmacharya is a means, not an end. It usually includes cleanliness, ahimsa, simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods, intoxicants, and behaviors-(including sexual behavior).

THERE IS A TRUTH EXHUMER CALLED CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL IN TOWN.

.. Proud to be Hindu April 2, 2018 at 8:30 AM ISKON is trying to turn Sanatan Dharma into one God one religion.

Believe in only one God,God Krishna or u will not get Moksha. 



Capt. Ajit Vadakayil April 2, 2018 at 9:35 AM ISKON IS A BHAKTI MOVEMENT OF SRILA PRABHUPADA

IT IS NOW HIJACKED BY WHITE MEN

IN THEIR DISCOURSES -- THERE IS MORE PROMINENCE TO A FELLOW NAMED CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU --WHO NEVER EXISTED

CHAITANYA BABY IS INSPIRED BY RADHA --WHO NEVER EXISTED

ROTHSCHILD SELECTED MAYAPUR TO SPREAD CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU FUNDA --FOR POLITICAL REASONS-- HE HAD HIS OPIUM FACTORY HERE

ROTHSCHILDs AGENT -- A FELLOW NAMED BHAKTIVINODA THAKUR WAS USED TO SPREAD FAKE GAUDIYA RADHA STUFF AND MADHAVACHARYA WHO NEVER EXISTED.

THE FAKE UDIPI MUTT DOES PROPAGANDA FOR MADHAVACHARYA -- WE NEVER HEARD OF MADHAVACHARYA OR CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU TILL THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA.

THE BULLSHIT ""HARE KRISHNA HARE RAMA MANTRA"" HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SRI RAM

THIS RAM IS INCLUDED TO FOOL HINDUS

IT IS ABOUT RADHA RAMANA

RAMANA MEANS LOVER -- YOU SEE RADHA WAS A LOVER OF KRISHNA--HIS MISTRESS WHO NEVER EXISTED IN ANY PURANA ..

Telugu man Gopala Bhatta Goswami is a FAKE and backdated creation-- the disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. You see Chaitanya baby revealed to Goswami baby that he is an avatar of Krishna ( BALLS !)

Goswami baby created the Radha Raman Temple--which was actually an old Vishnu temple retro installed -- with a shaligram deity of Krishna alongside Radharani.

I WANT MY READERS TO SPREAD THE TRUTH

HARE RAMA OF THE CHANT BY ISKON -- HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SRI RAM.

CHANTING THIS BULLSHIT MANTRA OF HARE RAMA ( RADHA ) HARE KRISHA DOES YOU NO GOOD

Radha-vallabha is another fake sect--where Krishna is called the consort of Radha. Here Radha is the deity-- Krishna is just a side-kick

Shri Radhavallabhlal temple at Vrindavan was a Vishnu temple converted to Radha and Krishna idol - a 2 in 1 .

IN SANKHYA JEW ROTHSCHILD HAS USED HIS AGENTS LIKE PRABHUPADA TO SUBSTITUTE SHIVA / SHAKTI WITH KRISHNA ( A MERE AVATAR OF VISHNU ) AND A FAKE MISTRESS RADHA .

POISON INJECTED VERSES BELOW--

radha purna-sakti, krsna purna-saktiman
dui vastu bheda nai, sastra-paramana
mrgamada, tara gandha yaiche aviccheda
agni, jvalate yaiche kabhu nahi bheda
radha-krsna aiche sada eka-i svarupa
lila-rasa asvadite dhare dui-rupa

Sri Radha is the full energy, and Lord Krsna is the possessor of full power.

The two are not different, as evidenced by the revealed scriptures. They are indeed the same, just as musk and its scent are inseparable, or as fire and its heat are nondifferent. Thus Radha and Lord Krsna are one, yet They have taken two forms to enjoy the mellows of pastimes. (Cc. Adi 4.96-98)

isvarera sakti haya e-tina prakara
eka laksmi-gana, pure mahisi-gana ara
vraje gopi-gana ara sabhate pradhana
vrajendra-nandana ya'te svayam bhagavan

The energies (consorts) of the Supreme Lord are of three kinds: the Laksmis in Vaikuntha, the queens in Dvaraka, and the gopis in Vrndavana. The gopis are the best of all, for they have the privilege of serving Sri Krsna, the primeval Lord, the son of the King of Vraja (Cc. Adi 1.79,80)

SORRY -- All this bull about Radha being a mistress of Lord Krishna and all his thousands of Gopikas whom he flirted with , are all poisons injected into Hinduism by the white Christian invader. Kalidas who invented Radha never existed. Krishna did NOT have 16000 virgin gopikas in vrindavan rather 16000 are dhatus of shasrara chakra . SAHASRARA CHAKRA is a 1000 petalled lotus -- each with 16 kalas or aspects --this works out to 16000 .

this is NOT some girl who has sex with Lord Krishna --taking turns to HUMP.

Narakasura kidnapped 16000 damsels --and Lord Krishna saved these damsels in distress. this is just an allegory.

CONTINUED TO 2- 
Capt. Ajit Vadakayil April 2, 2018 at 9:36 AM CONTINUED FROM 1-

Bhagavata Purana 10.59.42-- is poison injected :--

atho muhUrta ekasmin
nAnAgAreSu tAH striyaH
yathopayeme bhagavAn
tAvad-rUpa-dharo 'vyayaH

“ Then the imperishable Bhagavan [ Sri Krishna], assuming a separate form for each bride, duly married all the princesses simultaneously, each in her own palace.”

This alludes to 16,000 virgins ( gopikas ). 16000 gopikas never existed-- for it is an allegory.

PRABHUPADA WENT AROUND LYING THAT CHAITANYA WAS A AVATAR OF VISHNU

Jew Rothschild inserted a POISON INJECTED chapter Chaitanya Upanishad --in the Atharvaveda

Today Gaudiya Vaishnavas, revere Chaitanya baby as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha.

FAKE Chaitanya Mahaprabhu kept singing the praises of Radha.

EVERY DESH DROHI LITERARY FEST --HAD ATHEIST COMMIES SINGING PRAISES OF KRISHNAs MISTRESS RADHA.

KRISHNA IS JUST AN AVATAR OF VISHNU-- LIKE SRI RAM AND AYYAPPA.

JAYADEVA WHO INVENTED RADHA NEVER EXISTED. HE WAS A FAKE AND BACKDATED CREATION OF JEW ROTHSCHILD.

odissi dance is full of RADHA nonsense. Jayadeva's ashtapadis that are sung in dance performances of Odissi. Oriya bhajans are all ragas and talas specified by Jayadeva's hymns.

THE FAKE MUTTS OF ROTHSCHILD SPREAD THE FAKE WORK OF JAYADEVA ""GITA GOVINDA "" IN TAMIL NADU AND ANDHRA.

In April 16, 2007 Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC III) mentioned Jayadeva as the court poet of king Lakshmanasena of Bengal. And all Oriya Puri party got pissed off.

The Italian waitress release stamps of the FAKE jayadeva in 2009. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik unveiled the stamps at a special function in Jayadev Bhawan

BONGS claim Jayadeva as their own and hold BAUL festival at Kendubilva , west bengal.

Like how Jayadeva found Radha Madhava idols in a river, same way the FAKE madhavacharya of Udipi found a idol of krishna in the sea.

The Mahabharata or ancient Puranas mention Krishna , but NEVER EVER a woman named Radha.

During British Rule all Krishna temples idols were roved to insert Radha as a jodi.

The FAKE Geeta-Govinda was full of immoral sex and erotica to describe the ILLICIT love between ""Radha"" and a married Krishna.

Foul and explicit SEXUAL passages were deleted by Jew Rothschild when original Hindu Mutts protested .

EVEN TODAY DELETED BENGALI VERSES ARE SUNG --

SHOKALE UTTIYO KANU--DOH HAATHE DHARIYO NUNU--THAKAYILE RADHAR GUDHE

( Krishna worke up at dawn , he lifted his heavy prick with both hands--and showed it into Radha's cunt )

WORSE SONGS WERE SUNG EVEN LAST YEAR AT KODUNGALLUR TEMPLE IN KERALA

KODUNGALLUR AMMAYE PANNANAM ENGIL KODIMARAM POLEY ORU KUNNA VENAM

if you want to satisfy Devi ( wife of Shiva ) you need a prick as large as a temple flagpole.

ALL THIS BLASPHEMY HAD BEEN TOLD TO PM MODI AT LEAST 50 TIMES-- PATHETIC FELLOW MODI IS MORE INVOLVED IN GIVING US HAJAAAR JAANKARI ABOUT GANDHI AND BR AMBEDKAR ..

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/03/kodungallur-bharani-festival-capt-ajit.html 

The FAKE Geeta Govinda still contains ABRIDGED verses like the one below--

प्रथम समागम लज्जितया, पटु चाटु शतै: अनुकूलम् .
मृदु मधुर स्मित भाषितया, शिथिली कृत जघन दुकूलम्

THE WHITE INVADER CREATED HUNDREDS OF FAKE HINDU MUTTS ONLY TO DIVIDE AND RULE… TO DO PROPAGANDA THAT THERE WAS UNTOUCHABILITY SYSTEM WHICH OPPRESSED THE DALITS..

SORRY---

UNTOUCHABILITY EXISTED ONLY IN KERALA… AND THAT TOO IT WAS STARTED 6000 YEARS AGO BY VISHNU AVATAR PARASHURAMA FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON..

AFTER CONVEYING VEDAS ORALLY FOR 330 CENTURIES IT WAS DECIDED TO PEN DOWN THE VEDAS 70 CENTURIES AGO..

THE HUMAN DNA WAS DEGRADING AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-FRACTAL MINDS TO MEMORISE SUCH HUMONGOUS AMOUNTS OF SANSKRIT VERSES..

FROM 5000 BC TO 4000 BC , IT WAS KERALA NAMBOODIRIS WHO CONVEYED VEDAS ORALLY – AS THEY COULD STILL DO IT..   THE WRITTEN VEDAS WERE IN THE CUSTODY ON KERALA NAMBOODIRIS AT THE BANKS OF THE RIVER SARASWATI..

NOW LISTEN—THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF THIS COMMENT…

IN 4000 BC ,RIVER SARASWATI DRIED UP DUE TO A TECTONIC SHIFT AT THE GLACIAL MOUTH IN THE HIMALAYAS…

THE BROTHER OF KRISHNA BALARAMA TOOK HIS GIGANTIC PLOW ( FOR LEVERAGE ) AND SHIFTED THE SARSWATI WATERS TO GANGA AND YAMUNA –LEAVING ONLY THE UNDERGROUND SARASWATI RIVER FLOWING..

THIYYAS WERE THE ORIGINAL ROYALS OF KERALA— LATER JEW ROTHSCHILD CREATED A CRYPTO JEW VARMA CLAN WHO BECAME KERALA ROYALS..

THERE WERE NO VARMAS BEFORE THE WHITE INVADER CAME TO INDIA… THIYYAS, WERE DEMOTED TO “ COCONUT TREE TODDY TAPPERS”..

SAME WAY MAHARS ( BR AMBEDKARs CLAN ) WERE NOT DALITS… MAHARS WERE RULING CASTE OF MAHARASHTRA … MAHARASTRA IS THE RASHTRA OF MAHARS…. LATER CHITPAVAN JEWS BECAME RULING CLASS. ..

PARASHURAMA CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE ONLY THE ELDEST NAMBOODIRI BROTHER COULD OWN FERTILE LAND IN KERALA …

THIS WAS TO PREVENT SUBDIVISION AND FRAGMENTATION OF FERTILE LAND WHICH IS INDIAs BIGGEST PROBLEM TODAY AND REASON FOR FARMERS SUICIDES..

NAMBOODIRIS GOT DRUNK WITH POWER ( SOCIAL STATUS, KNOWLEDGE , LAND AND WEALTH ) AND BECAME DECADENT IN THE PERIOD FROM 4000 BC TO 2000 BC..

THERE GOES THE FALSE THEORY THAT THERE WAS NO CONCEPT OF BHARAT IN THE ANCIENT DAYS..

THERE WAS A CONDITION SET BY PARASHURAMA –THAT THESE 4 ORIGINAL HINDU MUTTS COULD BE HEADED ONLY BY A VEDA ( ORAL ROUTE ) KNOWING KERALA NAMBOODIRI PONTIFF…

THIS LONG TRADITION WAS BROKEN BY JEW ROTHSCHILD WHO RULED INDIA… EVEN THE 4 ORIGINAL MUTTS HAS CRYPTO JEW PONTIFFS WITH PALE EYES WHO TROUBLED DALITS.. ALONG WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND FAKE MUTT PONTIFFS WHO WERE THE BRIBED AGENTS OF THE WHITE INVADER…

INDIA IS RACING TO BE THIS PLANETs NO 1 SUPERPOWER IN ANOTHER 15 YEARS …

THE WHITE MAN WILL NEVER ALLOW A BROWN MAN TO LORD OVER HIM… ALL BR AMBEDKAR/ EVR PERIYAR STUDENTS UNION LEADERS ARE FUNDED AND CONTROLLED BY WHITE JEWS ….

BOTH BR AMBEDKAR AND EVR PERIYAR WERE AGENTS OF JEW ROTHSCHILD AND DID NOT WANT THE WHITE INVADER TO LEAVE INDIA…

YES THE COOK ON A SHIP CAN ASPIRE TO BE CAPTAIN.. BUT FIRST HE MUST PASS AN EXAM…

WE CANT HAVE QUOTA FOR DALITS IN ISRO OR A QUOTA FOR DONKEYS ON A RACE COURSE..

YOU CANT TEACH A DONKEY TO SING — WISDOM…

AS LONG AS THERE IS QUOTA SYSTEM , THERE WILL BE BRAIN DRAIN FROM INDIA …. NO HORSE WILL AGREE TO BE LORDED OVER BY A DONKEY ON A RACE COURSE..

BY ALL MEANS GIVE FREE EDUCATION TO DALITS—BUT IT MUST STOP THERE … GIVING JOB RESERVATIONS AND EVEN PROMOTIONS WILL NOT HELP BHARATMATA..

OUR CONSTIITUTION DEMANDS THAT ALL CITIZENS BE TREATED THE SAME.. 

DALIT LEADERS LIKE KANCHA ILAIAH AND JNU COMMIE PROFESSORS MUST NOT LONGER LIE THAT DALITS WERE SUPRESSED FOR MILLIUNIUMS ..

IT HAPPENED ONLY IN KERALA , NOT THE REST OF INDIA… UNTOUCHABILITY IN KERALA WAS TO PRESERVE , NOT SUPRESS..

The State government has decided to declare nine districts as drought-hit. 
The decision to declare Alappuzha, Kannur, Idukki, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur, and Wayanad districts as drought-hit was taken by a meeting of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. 
Notification 
The meeting directed the State Relief Commissioner to issue the formal notification in this regard. 
The meeting, attended by Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar, Chief Secretary Paul Antony, Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) P.H. Kurien, and KSDMA member secretary Sekhar L. Kuriakose, decided to declare the nine districts drought-hit based on criteria such as rainfall deficit, shortfall in availability of surface water and groundwater and salt influx. 
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there was considerable shortfall in rain in these districts during the northeast monsoon. The IMD had also predicted serious drinking water shortage in these districts. 
Idukki did not have drought-like condition until now. The district was, however, declared drought-hit given the possibility of major water sources drying up, resulting in drinking water shortage. 
Urgent steps would be taken for supply of drinking water in the affected districts. 
Tankers would be used to supply water kiosks. 
In the event of sufficient funds not being available with the local government institutions for drinking water supply, funds can be accessed from the State Disaster Response Fund. 
Last month, the SDMA had initiated steps to declare nine districts drought-hit after soaring mercury levels in early summer led to water stress. Palakkad and Kozhikode have already reported daytime temperature higher than 40 degrees Celsius on several days, indicating heatwave conditions. 
Summer forecast 
The annual summer forecast issued by the India Meteorology Department has predicted that the summer of 2018 will be hotter, with maximum temperatures going up by at least one degree above normal. 
The government has expedited the work on water supply schemes and temporary check-dams to address the drinking water shortage. 
Restoration of local water sources, construction of rainwater pits and subsurface dykes and establishment of water filling stations for tanker lorries have been stepped up.",english

Medicinal plants will be planted in each household in association with Kudumbasree, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
He was speaking after inaugurating a new manufacturing unit of Oushadhi at Muttathara here on Tuesday. 
As many medicinal plants were disappearing owing to excessive use of fertilizers, steps to conserve and cultivate them were needed, the Chief Minister said. Commercialisation impact 
Easily available medicinal plants had propelled Ayurveda to the forefront in the State. However, of late, the impact of lack of plants and certain other factors could not be ignored. Commercialisation had had an impact on the sector. 
He said lack of medicines to meet demand was the reason for starting the new Oushadhi factory. Ten important medicines would be manufactured here. 
Steps to set up an international Ayurveda research institute were on, the Chief Minister said. 
Minister for Health K.K. Shylaja who presided over the function said an Ayurveda medicine policy would be framed for comprehensive development of the sector.",english

In his petition on December 22, 2017, Prof. K.V. George alleged that authorities of the medical college had presented faked documents of students admitted under the NRI quota.
“The college presented documents that had nothing to show that they were genuine, which resulted in the cancellation of admission of several eligible candidates including my daughter who had applied online,” he said in his petition. The ASC order substantiates his contention. “Even a cursory look of the applications shows that they are not actual ‘online applications’. The forms do not show the name of the Medical College to which the applications were made,” the ASC had said, cancelling the order.
Prof George pointed out in his petition that the Supreme Court had on October 28, 2017 ordered the college not to admit anymore students after that date. “However, the police raided Central Avenue Hotel in Kannur on October 30 and confiscated documents related to admissions,” he said in his complaint. “The police recorded the statements of students, parents and college officials and presented them in the court.”
Prof. George said the chief minister’s Office sent him a reply saying the petition has been forwarded to the additional chief secretary (health) for further action. “I have heard nothing after that. A lot of eligible students were made to suffer for the criminal act of the college and hence the government should order a probe to ensure that the guilty are punished,” he told DC.",english

KOCHI: As the state is swirling under severe summer heat, state government has decided to declare nine districts as drought affected, according to media reports. The state Disaster Management Authority (DMA) will declare Alapuzha, Kannur, Idukki, Kasargod, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Wayanad as drought hit districts. DMA has already directed the state Relief Commissioners to declare the districts drought hit.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is also the chairman of the Disaster Management Authority, presided over a meeting held on Tuesday which was attended by Minister for Revenue E Chandrashekaran, Minister for Agriculture VS Sunilkumar, Chief secretary Paul Antony, Revenue Additional Chief Secretary PH Kurian and DMA member secretary Shekar Kuriakose.According to reports, fewer amounts of rainfall and depleting ground water level are the main reasons which prompted state government to declare the nine districts drought affected. As per the Meteorological statistics, the NE monsoon (from October to December) has not given ample rainfall to the districts in 2017. The Met Department has issued a warning that there would be shortage in drinking water in all these districts this summer. The water bodies in many districts have already dried up.The Authority has asked the state government to prepare for the impending water crisis in the state. The government has already embarked on measures to provide drinking water to all the affected districts. Water kiosks will be set up at various points in the districts.State Disaster Fund will be utilised for the meeting the emergency situation, as the funds from the local governments are yet to be made available.The Union government had revealed that severe drought has hit seven states in the country paving way for price rise in many states including Kerala. A total of 185 districts including seven in Andhra and 27 in Karnataka have been declared drought-hit. As Kerala depends mainly on Andhra and Karnataka for rice and vegetables, the state will be affected by drought and crop loss in these states.

What began as a protest by 60-odd farmers in a municipal town has turned into a battle of environment activists in Kerala. The farmers have been protesting against a proposed bypass through their paddy field in the CPM-dominated agricultural belt of Keezhattur in Taliparamba municipal town of Kannur. 
On Sunday, scores of environment activists converged on Kezhattur in a movement they billed “Kerala to Keezhattur”, and took a pledge that they would not allow the paddy field to be reclaimed for the project. The previous day, the ruling CPM had gathered at the same venue to assert its resolve to execute the project, which had been envisaged by the previous Congress government. 
The BJP has compared the movement to the 2007 agitation in Nandigram of West Bengal, where 14 farmers were killed in police firing while protesting against the then Left government’s move to acquire land for an industrial project. The BJP plans to bring farmers of Nandigram to Keezhattur next week. 
The bypass off NH-66 is proposed to be 5.7 km long and 45 m wide. It requires the acquisition of 70 acres, including 12 acres in Keezhattur. Of this, the paddy field accounts for only 5 acres. And of the 5.7-km bypass, 1.4 km would pass through Keezhattur. 
Keezhattur is a CPM-dominated village and the agitation against the party-led government came from within the communist cadre. In September 2017, a section of CPM workers agitated against the project through the village, immediately grabbing media attention. The agitators, all CPM cadres or sympathisers, formed a forum, Vayal Kilikal (birds of the paddy field) against the bypass alignment. The CPM ousted 12 members from two branches on charges of joining the agitation. They erected a shed on the field, stood guard by turns, staged a hunger-strike for 20 days, and formed a human chain to protect the field. They ceased the agitation after the government assured them it would look into their demands, then resumed on March 14 when the NHAI and state revenue officials began earmarking land for acquisition. Some 40 agitators threatened to immolate themselves. Taken into custody, they were released only after the officials had completed their survey. Other CPM workers extended protection to the land survey team. 
Suresh Keezhattur, a former CPM worker leading the agitation, has become a familiar face in TV debates. “This is not an issue of Keezhattur alone,” he said. “In 2007, the LDF government had brought in legislation to protect paddy fields and wetlands. We don’t want the highway built through the paddy field. We are trying to implement what the CPM has stated in the policy.” 
Asked how many land-owners are protesting, Suresh said he didn’t want to go into the numbers or the compensation offered by the government. “We will not back out of this agitation. The CPM had led several agitations against filling of paddy fields. Vayal Kilikal will take support from any party or organisation to prevent a road through our field, whatever the compensation,” he said, 
NHAI liaison officer K Abdulla said, “Of 60 land-owners on this stretch of 1.4 km, 56 have already given consent for acquisition. In other villages along the proposed 5.7-km highway, paddy farmers have no objection. None of the agitators will lose his house, only a portion of his paddy land.” 
A leader of Vayal Kilikal, C Manoharan, countered this: “Although the government claims 56 land-owners have given consent, 23 land-owners are still with us. Many have consented under pressure from the CPM.” 
Abdulla said the NHAI is paying compensation at a very high rate. “In neighbouring Anthoor municipality, we gave Rs 3 lakh to 4.25 lakh for a cent of land (a 100th part of an acre) as per tariff fixed in 2013. Keezhattur is part of Taliparamba municipality. Those who surrender land for the bypass will get higher compensation as per the revised rate of 2015.” 
About the alignment, Abdulla said: “At Keezhattur, we have aligned the bypass to the side of the paddy field and there will be culverts every 250 m to prevent waterlogging. With this alignment, 60% of paddy field will be available with farmers,”. 
When the bypass was first proposed, the government had considered other options. Under one alternative, over 100 houses/business establishments would have to be pulled down. Under the alignment planned through Keezhattur, 30 houses would have to be demolished. Owners of such houses at Koppam village have already consented to acquisition. In Keezhattur, none of the agitators will need to give up his or her house. 
Nambradath Janaki, 70, one of the faces of the agitation in the media, does not have an inch slated for acquisition. A farm worker, she lives at least 70 m from the alignment. 
Except leader Suresh, none of the agitators has more than an acre at stake. Asked why farmers with 10 to 20 cents cannot take the compensation and buy more land, Manoharan, who farms one acre of leased land, said, “We are attached to this land. A road can be built, but can you build a paddy field or wetland that have evolved over generations?” 
Local CPM leader and municipal councillor P Prakashan alleged, “The paddy field was lying idle until two years ago. They resumed cultivation in light of the bypass project.” Taliparamba’s CPM MLA James Mathew said: “If environmental conservation is their objective, would it be possible by protecting a 1-km stretch of paddy field in Keezhattur? The agitation by Vayal Kilikal does not have the backing of local people or farmers, so they are trying to whip up environmental concerns. Several other bypasses, which require conversion of large tracts of paddy fields, are under construction in Kerala. The LDF government has brought in legislation to protect paddy fields and wetlands. At the same time, there are provisions for reclaiming wetlands/paddy fields for public purposes, such as highways. The government has to take infrastructure development forward .” 
The Congress has not officially backed the agitation, the proposal having come during its regime. The BJP has planned a march to Keezhattur on April 3, extending support to the agitators, and announcing that it would bring party workers from Nandigram to Keezhattur. BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas said the CPM should give up its stubborn stand on the bypass and that the central government is ready for a discussion on the issue.

IF INDIA HAS TO NIP OUT PAKISTAN AIDED TERRORISM IN KASHMIR , ARTICLE 370 AND 35A MUST GO..

WE DO NOT NEED TO RUN TO ANY COLLEGIUM JUDGE…

WE DO NOT CARE FOR THESE UNCONSTITUTIONAL COLLEGIUM JUDGES..

Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The article is drafted in Part XXI of the Constitution: Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions.

The State's Constituent Assembly was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution to be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether.

After the state Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending abrogation, the Article 370 was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.

THE ELECTIONS TO THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ASSEMBLY IN 1951 WERE RIGGED.

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/01/the-kashmir-conflict-capt-ajit-vadakayil.html 

They exploited Article 370, and adopted Sections 6, 8 and 9 for incorporation in the Constitution under which the State was to be governed in the future.

Article 370 gave the solitary State of Jammu & Kashmir the right to have a separate Constitution and separate flag, but nowhere does it say which category of Indians will enjoy all citizenship rights in Jammu & Kashmir and which sections will not.

PARAMOUNT CLAUSE: "" ETHNIC CLEANSING "" - OF SIX LAKHS KASHMIRI PANDITS BY KASHMIRI MUSLIMS SUPPORTED BY PAKISTAN, MAKES ARTICLE 370 NULL AND VOID…

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/09/uniform-civil-code-in-india-capt-ajit.html 

Jawaharlal Nehru, the HALF BROTHER of Sheikh Abdullah (who married the wife of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-- JEWESS BEGUM AKBAR JEHAN) subverted the basic structure of the Indian Constitution in May 1954 to deprive all Indian citizens, including refugees from West Pakistan settled in Jammu province. of their fundamental right to exercise all rights in Jammu & Kashmir…

Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah made sure that the Permanent Residents of Jammu & Kashmir shall exercise all rights all over India…

Nehru amended Article 368 without taking the Indian Parliament into confidence, THOUGH Parliament alone had the power to amend or not amend the Constitution, to amend Article 35 and add to it the atrocious Article 35A which was enforced in Jammu & Kashmir through the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, May 1954.

Article 35A enabled the Jammu & Kashmir Constituent Assembly to deny citizenship rights to the HINDU refugees from West Pakistan and all other Indians, barring Permanent Residents of the State.

Armed with absolute power, the Jammu & Kashmir Constituent Assembly adopted Section 6 which said no persons who had crossed over to the state after May 1944 will be considered eligible for citizenship rights.

Nehru enforced Article 35A in Jammu & Kashmir UNCONSTITUTIONALLY - More important he criminally CONCEALED it.

He hid the amendments from the public, by not mentioning the same in the main body of the Constitution—read this line twice.

The unconstitutional amendments to Article 368 and Article 35 were mentioned only in Appendix-I and Appendix-II, respectively, so that they could escape public attention in a CRIMINAL MANNER.

AN APPENDIX CAN NEVER HIJACK THE MAIN BODY OF ANY ARTICLE.

ANY IDIOT KNOWS THIS UNLESS HE IS SENILE.

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 2:57 PM CONTINUED FROM 1-

Nehru in cahoots with his HALF BROTHER Sheikh Abdullah conspired against the HINDU refugees from West Pakistan, and then further hatched a conspiracy against all Indian citizens, in order to pander to communalists in Kashmir, by subverting Articles 16 and 19 of the Indian Constitution which deal with the rights of Indian citizens, including fundamental rights.

Article 19, for example, says that “All citizens shall have the right (a) to freedom of speech and expression, (b) to assemble peacefully and without arms, (c) to form associations or unions, (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India, (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business”.

It follows that what is needed is not just the abrogation of Article 370 but also the revocation of Article 35A. This is the only course left to enable the refugees from West Pakistan and other Indians to exercise citizenship rights in Jammu & Kashmir and integrate it fully into India.

In October 2015, the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir has ruled that the Article 370 cannot be ""abrogated, repealed or even amended.""

It explained that the clause (3) of the Article conferred power to the State's Constituent Assembly to recommend to the President on the matter of the repeal of the Article.

Since the Constituent Assembly did not make such a recommendation before its dissolution in 1957, the Article 370 has taken on the features of a ""permanent provision"" despite being titled a temporary provision in the Constitution.

BALLS !

WHAT IS DONE BY DECEIT IS "" NULL AND VOID ""..

Article 35A came into existence by a Presidential Order passed by Dr. Rajandra Prasad ( Rothschild sponsored FAKE Kayastha ) on the advice of Nehru’s cabinet in 1954...

President of India has sole legislative power under article 123 power to make ordinance when either house of the Parliament is not in session.

- This legislative powers of the President has an EXPIRY SHELL PERIOD OF MERE SIX MONTHS....

The Constitution can be amended only by the Parliament as per procedure clearly laid out in Article 368. but Article 35A was never presented before the Parliament of India…

This effectively means, in this case, the President bypassed the amending procedure as laid out in the Constitution of India in order to add the new Article 35A…

This also means that Article 368 of the Constitution, in its application to Jammu and Kashmir, also got amended!..

The President of India does not have legislative power, but here in this case he performed the function of Parliament!..

Article 35A appears in the Constitution as an appendix…How can an Article, which has been implemented on the ground as if it’s a part of the Constitution, be missing from the text of the Constitution ?

Article 35A was an amendment in our Constitution via the back door (Presidential order), without the involvement of India’s Parliament…

Article 35A is an example of the abuse of Article 370. Article 35A is a violation of the basic structure of our Constitution. Article 35A spawned a set of laws that were discriminatory in nature. ..

It curbs certain basic rights enshrined in the very Preamble of the Constitution. A Kashmiri woman marrying a non-permanent resident or outsider loses all succession rights, while a Kashmiri man does not.

As a result of the implementation of Article 35A,.lakhs of Indian HINDU citizens have been deprived of “ JUSTICE, social, economic and political ” and “ EQUALITY of status and of opportunity ”...

In the laws under Article 370 read with Article 35A even the President of India may be denied a place or land for official purpose. This is a breach of trust…

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 2:58 PM CONTINUED FROM 2--

Democratic India cannot allow any section of its population to be treated as second-rate citizens in any part of the country.

Article 368 is the only way to amend the Constitution,.. Not the President.

The marginal note of Article 368 states; “ Power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and procedure, therefore ”.. Which means it is the Parliament that has the power to amend the Constitution.

Sub-clause 2 of the Article 368 states that: --
“ An amendment of this Constitution may be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament, and when the Bill is passed in each House by majority of not less than two-third of the members of that House present and voting, [it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon] the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of Bill...""

The President of India does NOT have the sole UNBRIDLED power to amend the constitution through the bypass of the entire Constitutional mechanism nor does Article 370 give power to the President to insert any Article in any Part of the Constitution....

The parliamentary route of lawmaking was bypassed when the President incorporated Article 35A into the Constitution. Article 368 (i) of the Constitution empowers only Parliament to amend the Constitution. The President acted outside his jurisdiction.. Article 35A is void because the Nehru government did not place it before Parliament for discussion..

Article 370 grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A empowers the state legislature to define permanent citizens.

Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian Constitution are an ""unnecessary baggage"" of the past and hence these laws be repealed..

Restricting citizens from other States from getting employment or buying property within Jammu and Kashmir is a violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution…

Article 370 (along with Article 35A) is an anachronistic decree that has outlived its utility, militates against India’s sovereignty, and discriminates against both Indians and Kashmiris by mutually excluding each other from syncretic growth. It is redundant, and constitutionally discarded into the dustbin of history.

THE TERM "" SUBJUDIDE "" DOES NOT APPLY TO INDIA.. AS WE DON’T HAVE A JURY SYSTEM..

Capt. Ajit Vadakayil March 27, 2018 at 11:32 PM SOMEONE ASKED ME--

WHY DO YOU SAY THE DEEP STATE APPOINTS I&B MINISTERS IN MOST NATIONS..

OK CHECK THIS OUT ?

EVER HEARD OF PRISM ? 

PRISM is a tool used by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to collect private electronic data belonging to users of major internet services like Facebook

National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the US Director of National Intelligence. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine.

PRISM began in 2007..

Its existence was leaked six years later by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as ""dangerous"" and ""criminal"" activities""

NSA has ""direct access"" to the servers of Google, Facebook, and others

PRISM’s existence was leaked by Edward Snowden before he entered into ongoing asylum in Moscow. Microsoft was the first company to join the PRISM program.

The then Minister of External Affairs Salman Khurshid ( of a particular DNA same as ex-President Zakir Hussain ) defended the PRISM program saying, ""This is not scrutiny and access to actual messages"". It is only computer analysis of patterns of calls and emails that are being sent. It is not actually snooping specifically on content of anybody's message or conversation. Some of the information they got out of their scrutiny, they were able to use it to prevent serious terrorist attacks in several countries.""

Khurshid baby's comments contradicted his Foreign Ministry's characterization of violations of privacy as ""unacceptable.""

We know why Modi chose some of his I&B ministers- my lips are sealed as of now.

THIS STUNT BY MUSLIMS TO PLAY AORUND WITH BABRI MASJID CASE WILL NOT BEAR FRUIT.

IMPEACHING CJI IS NOT EASY AT ALL.

There had to be an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session.

First and foremost, under Art 124, a Notice of motion, may be given by 100 members of Lok Sabha or 50 members of Rajya Sabha. Then, the Speaker or the chairman may refuse or accept the motion.

IN THIS CASE WE THE PEOPLE EXPECT THE SPEAKER TO REJECT IT OUTRIGHT !

Unless both the houses approach the president, the president CANNOT remove the judge under Art 124(4).    As of now this is IMPOSSIBLE unless the sun rises in the west and the crow files upside down or Rahul Gandhi the donkey metamorphoses to a race horse

ALL POLITICIANS WHO ARE CRIMINALLY TRYING TO IMPEACH THE CJI MUST BE PROFILED AND PUNISHED

LIKE HOW INDAN COOLIES WERE SHIPPED ABROAD AS SLAVES BY DELIBERATE FAMINE – ROTHSCHILD EXPORTED IRISH TO NORTH AMERICA BY INTRODUCING THE POTATO BLIGHT AND DELIBERATE FAMINE

http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2010/04/indentured-coolie-slavery-reinvented.html 

Irish Potato blight was caused by Fungus Phytophthora infestans imported by Rothschild from America

THE ROTTEN POTATOES WHERE SHIPPED TO BELGIUM AND TRIED IN EUROPEAN AIR CONDITIONS AND THEN THIS BLIGHT EXPORTED TO IRELAND. ( 'Phytophthora Infestans' – an air carried fungus.)

Carbonate–silicate cycle plays a large part in the carbon cycle, since the equilibrium point of the carbonate-silicate cycle dictates the pace of carbon release from the lithosphere Roshan Raghunathan March 28, 2018 at 5:43 PM Capt, how does the static electricity that you mentioned work on a cricket ball both when it is old and new? Players have surreptitiously used saliva sweetened by chewing gum, vaseline and hair gels to maintain the shine on one side of the ball and other abrasive objects like bottle caps, zippers, sandpaper on the other side to induce reverse swing on a softer, older ball. The australians got caught now but to be honest, every team probably does it to some extent which explains very often why the ball starts reversing around the 30th and 40th over in test matches itself where ptherwise it probably might not until much later. It is certain that the Australians have been doing things to the ball for some time now and it was only a commentator who told the cameraman to keep an eye on them that enabled them to be caught red-handed now. Would appreciate it if you shed more light on this.

FOREIGN AGENCIES CONTROL THE STUDENT LEADERS OF EVR PERIYAR/ BR AMBEDKAR COLLEGE UNIONS ...

BENAMI TV CHANNELS CALL STUDIO AUDIENCES BASED ON THEIR TWITTER LEANINGS..

THIS LATEST THINGY OF TV CHANNELS ASKING VIEWERS TO GIVE A MISSED CALL IF THEY AGREE TO SOMETHING MUST STOP..

THE GORKHALAND STATE REVOLUTION STARTED WITH A CUNNING UNKNOWN MAN NAMED BIMAL GURUNG , ASKING GORKHAS ALL OVER THE WORLD TO GIVE HIM A MISSED CALL OVER SOME GORKHA PARTICIPATING IN A SINGING CONTEST ..( PRASHANT TAMANG --INDIAN IDOL 3 -2007 )..

When Tamang proceeded to the SMS-voting rounds, people of the hills made sure they left no stone unturned to keep Tamang in the contest…

GURUNG BABY THEN CONVERTED THESE SMS VOTE/ MISSED CALL PEOPLE INTO HIS FOLLOWERS BY BRAINWASHING THEM ..-- WITH FOREIGN FUNDED NGO SUPPORT ...

Bimal Gurung, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief, who was then working with Subhash Ghising in the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), raised huge amounts of money and created polling booths to finance a mass SMS campaign..

HUMONGOUS AMOUNTs OF MONEY CAME FROM NEPAL TO INDIA -ALL KICKSTARTED BY JNU COMMIE BABURAM BHATTARAI...WHO WAS MADE PM OF NEPAL AFTER THE ENTIRE ROYALTY WAS MURDERED…

HEGELIAN DIALECTIC was done -- some radio jockeys were bribed to mock Tamang and GURKHAS, saying that he was a chowkidar, which hurt Gorkha sentiments and intensified the FALSE PRIDE movement for a separate state. ..

NTR CASHED IN ON ""TELUGU PRIDE"" TO CLAW HIS WAY TO POWER WHEN RAJIV GANDHI ASKED ANJAIH REDDY WHY HE WASTED SO MUCH MONEY ON DECORATIONS OR HIS VISIT TO HYDERABAD .. IT WAS CONVERTED TO RAJIV GANDHI ABUSED TELUGU PEOPLE AND WE MUST TEACH HIM A LESSON..

I TOLD MY WIFE --THE LAST QUESTION WILL BE ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY -- SHE IS BUILDING UP MOMENTUM..

SUDDENLY BARKHA DUTT ASKED THE TV AUDIENCE ( HAND PICKED PICKLE JOHN/ CHUTNEY MARYs ) SELECTED BY TWITTER LEANINGS -- TO RAISE HANDS IF THEY SUPPORT HOMOSEXUALITY..

MY WIFE SAID -- THIS WAS THE FASTEST RAISE OF HANDS SHE EVER SAW IN HER LIFE..!

AND THEN THE FINAL QUESTION CAME --

""THIN UPPER LIPPED "" ARUN JAILTEY SAID - "" I AM WITH YOUR AUDIENCE "" ..

BY THE WAY HAVE YOU SEEN HOW THIN THE UPPER LIP OF CRYPTO JEW NIKKEY HALEY IS ?  SEE IT AGAIN…

WE ASK AJIT DOVAL / HOME MINISTER / DEFENCE MINISTER – TEACH OUR UNIFORMED OFFICERS THE MEANING OF HEGELIAN DIALECTIC…

WHY IS BHARATMATAs INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SECURITY GUARDED BY PEOPLE WHO CANT THINK FOR NUTS OR ARE NOT AWARE OF THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF WORLD INTRIGUE ?..

The decision has been taken keeping in view of the shortage of surface water and ground water in these regions. A meeting of the state disaster management authority was convened under the chairmanship of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to review the drought situation . In the meeting, the reports from the nine districts facing acute shortage of drinking water , were presented. Alappuzha, Kannur, Idukki, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Wayanad are the nine districts, which have been declared as drought hit. Specific instructions have been given to the disaster relief commissioner to take steps for effective management and responsiveness to minimize the impact of the drought. At the meeting it was observed that the districts declared drought hit have been facing severe shortage of rain water, surface water and ground water. Moreover, the level of salt water in these districts has been rising. “The main concern was the acute shortage of drinking water, for which specific instructions have been given to tackle the situation,’’ said Sekhar Kuriakose , member secretary of disaster management authority. He said adequate funds would be provided for the local bodies for providing the supply of drinking water. Already, the government has sanctioned funds for drinking water supply to the local bodies. If it turns out to be insufficient, the authority would sanction additional funds. The national meteorological department had already issued a warning on possible drinking water shortages in these nine districts due to the rain shortfall in 2017. The department had reported that the north-east monsoon was considerably weak in these districts. In the case of Idukki, it does not face a drought situation presently but things could turn worse due to the shortage of water in the water bodies in hilly areas. The authorities have warned of a possible shortage in drinking water if the situation worsens. Hence, the disaster management authority decided to include the district also in the list.

कोच्चिः पिछले महीने केरल मे एक 'बाबा' ने एक महिला के साथ जबरदस्ती करने की कोशिश की। इस पर महिला ने हवस में अंधे 'बाबा' के गुप्तांग काट दिए। घायल बाबा को अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया था। सर्जरी के बाद बाबा का दावा है कि इसके गुप्तांग वापस आ गए हैं। बाबा का कहना है कि इलाज के बाद अब वो ठीक से पेशाब कर सकता है। बाबा ने सुनाई दर्द की कहानी 
55 वर्षीय हरी स्वामी 'बाबा' ने बताया कि उसके गुप्तांगों को चाकू से काट दिया था, जिसके बाद बहुत दर्द हो रहा था, दर्द के बाद बाबा अपने गुप्तांगों को पूरी तरह से कटवाने की सोच रहा था। अपने आप को बाबा कहने वाले हरी स्वामी पर एक महिला से बलात्कार करने का आरोप लगा है। 20 मई को हुई थी घटना 
केरल पुलिस ने बताया कि ये घटना 20 मई की है, जब इस बाबा ने महिला के साथ जबरदस्ती करने की कोशिश की, इसके बाद युवती ने उसका गुप्तांग काट दिया और फिर पुलिस को फोन कर दिया। पुलिस ने बताया कि आरोपी बाबा लड़की का शारीरिक शोषण तबसे करता आ रहा है जब वह 12वीं में पढ़ती थी। बाबा ने किया था परिवार से बीमारी ठीक करने का दावा 
पुलिस का कहना है कि पीड़िता के पिता कई सालों से बिस्तर पर हैं। उनकी सेहत ठीक नहीं रहती। इसी दौरान पीड़िता की मां का संपर्क बाबा से हुआ। बाबा ने दावा किया कि वो उनके दुखों को ठीक कर देगा। इसी दौरान उसने पीड़िता का शोषण भी शुरू कर दिया। It was a courageous step, no doubt about it:Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan on girl who chopped off genitals of inmate from Panmana Ashram pic.twitter.com/67xqy3PDNB — ANI (@ANI) May 20, 2017 सीएम ने की थी तारीफ

The decision has been taken keeping in view of the shortage of surface water and ground water in these regions.
A meeting of the state disaster management authority was convened under the chairmanship of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to review the drought situation . In the meeting, the reports from the nine districts facing acute shortage of drinking water , were presented.
Alappuzha, Kannur, Idukki, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Wayanad are the nine districts, which have been declared as drought hit. Specific instructions have been given to the disaster relief commissioner to take steps for effective management and responsiveness to minimize the impact of the drought.
At the meeting it was observed that the districts declared drought hit have been facing severe shortage of rain water, surface water and ground water. Moreover, the level of salt water in these districts has been rising.
“The main concern was the acute shortage of drinking water, for which specific instructions have been given to tackle the situation,’’ said Sekhar Kuriakose , member secretary of disaster management authority.
He said adequate funds would be provided for the local bodies for providing the supply of drinking water. Already, the government has sanctioned funds for drinking water supply to the local bodies. If it turns out to be insufficient, the authority would sanction additional funds.
The national meteorological department had already issued a warning on possible drinking water shortages in these nine districts due to the rain shortfall in 2017. The department had reported that the north-east monsoon was considerably weak in these districts.
In the case of Idukki, it does not face a drought situation presently but things could turn worse due to the shortage of water in the water bodies in hilly areas.
The authorities have warned of a possible shortage in drinking water if the situation worsens. Hence, the disaster management authority decided to include the district also in the list.",english

കേരളത്തിലെ പ്രസ്‌ക്ലബുകളിൽ അംഗത്വമുള്ള പത്രപ്രവർത്തകർക്കായി ടൂറു പോകാൻ സർക്കാർ അനുവദിച്ചത് 40 ലക്ഷം രൂപയാണ്. സർക്കാർ ജീവനക്കാരല്ലാത്ത, ഭരണഘടനാപരമായി സാധാരണ പൗരനുള്ള അവകാശങ്ങൾ മാത്രമുള്ള മാധ്യമപ്രവർത്തകരാണ് സർക്കാർ ഫണ്ടിൽ നിന്നും പണം വാങ്ങി ടൂറിന് പോയത്. കേരളത്തിൽ എല്ലാ ജില്ലകളിലുമുള്ള പ്രസ് ക്ലബുകൾക്കായാണ് ടൂറിന് 40 ലക്ഷം രൂപയാണ് അനുവദിച്ചത്. ഈ വകയിൽ കോട്ടയം പ്രസ്‌ക്ലബ്ബിനും അഞ്ച് ലക്ഷം രൂപ ലഭിച്ചു.

The UDF staged a walkout later, alleging the government's lack of effective intervention in the matter, even as PWD minister G Sudhakaran, on behalf of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, mentioned that the law and order of the state is 'secure'. Pointing to the murder of a former radio jockey at nearby Madavoor yesterday, Opposition leader in the assembly Ramesh Chennithala said goons and quotation gangs were unleashing widespread violence in the state, causing a fear psychosis among the people. He also alleged that police, who are supposed to ensure protection to the life and property of people, were working in tandem with the anti-social elements in many cases. The ""politicisation"" of the police force and lack of effective interventions and follow-up action by the government had resulted in the goons having a free run, he said. ""All goons and quotation gangs are getting political protection in the state now,"" Chennithala said. Mentioning about the mandatory training imparted to police on Tuesday, to improve their professional behvariour, he said the ""police highhandedness"" was continuing even after the 'tution class' by the DGP. However, Sudhakaran rejected the opposition charges and said the police force was one of the best in the country and had won many awards and accolades for its efficiency. ""The government has taken effective steps to rein in goons, loan sharks and other anti-social elements. Some isolated incidents are happening. But the law and order conditions in the state is secure,"" he said. Over 400 cases had been registered under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities Prevention Act (KAPA) after the LDF government came to power and over 200 cases were registered under 'Operation Kubera', a drive against loan sharks, last year, he said. Though the minister admitted that there was 'criminalisation' in the police, he said the government's effort was to bring in change in this trend. He informed the House that a special investigation team was set up to probe the murder of the ex-radio jockey and folk singer, Rajesh and the culprits would be nabbed soon. Seeking notice for the adjournment motion over the issue, K Muraleedharan (Congress) said that criminal activities were becoming a continuous saga in the state. Police, who pretend to be protectors on one side, were becoming 'arachars' (hangmen) on the other side, he added. The Opposition staged a walkout after Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan disallowed the motion and took up other business of the day.",english

സംഭവം ഇങ്ങിനെ 
വരന്റെ വസതിയിൽ എത്തുന്നതിനു മുൻപു പുലിപ്പാറ വളവിൽ വച്ച് 4.10നു വധുവിന്റെ വീട്ടുകാർ സഞ്ചരിച്ച വാനും കെഎസ്ആർടിസി ബസും തമ്മിൽ ഉരസി. വാനിന്റെ ചില്ലു തകർന്നു. ബസിന്റെ ഡ്രൈവർ തട്ടിക്കയറി.ഡ്രൈവറുടെ പക്ഷം പിടിച്ച ബസ് യാത്രക്കാരനായ സ്പെഷൽ ബ്രാഞ്ച് പൊലീസുകാരൻ പാങ്ങോട് സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ വിളിച്ചതിനെതുടർന്ന് ഗ്രേഡ് എസ്ഐ ലത്തീഫിന്റെ നേതൃത്വത്തിലുള്ള പൊലീസ് സംഘം സ്ഥലത്തെത്തി. ചടങ്ങു മുടക്കരുതെന്നും അതിനുശേഷം സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ എത്താമെന്നും ഹക്കീം അഭ്യർഥിച്ചുവെങ്കിലും പൊലീസ് വഴങ്ങിയില്ല. 
ബസ് ‍ഡ്രൈവർ ബിജുമോനെയും വാനിൽ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്ന 27 പേരെയും സ്റ്റേഷനിലേക്കു കൊണ്ടുപോയി.ഹക്കീം, സഹോദരീ ഭർത്താവും വാഹനാപകടത്തിൽ കയ്യും കാലും തകർന്നയാളുമായ മാഹിൻ ജലാലുദീൻ, ബന്ധു നൗഫൽ എന്നിവരടക്കം അഞ്ചു പേരെ സെല്ലിൽ അടച്ചു. സംഘത്തിൽ ഹക്കീമിന്റെ ഭാര്യ ഷംല, സഹോദരിമാരായ ജമീമ, ജലീല എന്നിവരെ മുറ്റത്തുനിർത്തി.ചടങ്ങിനുശേഷം തിരിച്ചുവരാമെന്നു പറഞ്ഞു സെല്ലിനകത്തുനിന്നു ഹക്കീമും പുറത്തുനിന്നു ഷംലയും കരഞ്ഞപേക്ഷിച്ചെങ്കിലും പൊലീസ് തട്ടിക്കയറുകയായിരുന്നുവത്രെ.രാത്രി 9.30ന് എസ്ഐ എസ്.നിയാസ് സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ എത്തി. ഹക്കീമിനെ അകത്തുവിളിച്ച എസ്ഐ, ഡ്രൈവർ ആശുപത്രിയിൽ പോയിട്ടുണ്ടെന്നും ഒത്തുതീർപ്പാക്കിവന്നാൽ ആലോചിക്കാമെന്നും അറിയിച്ചു. 
സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്ന വരന്റെ വീട്ടുകാർ ഡ്രൈവറെ അന്വേഷിച്ചുപോയി. രാത്രി 10.30നു മടങ്ങിയെത്തിയ അവർ പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾ സംസാരിച്ചുതീർത്തുവെന്ന് അറിയിച്ചപ്പോൾ എഫ്ഐആർ റജിസ്റ്റർ ചെയ്തുവെന്നു പറഞ്ഞ് എസ്ഐ കൈമലർത്തുകയായിരുന്നുവത്രെ..തന്നെ ജയിലിലടച്ചു മകളുടെ വിവാഹം മുടക്കരുതെന്നു ഹക്കീം കരഞ്ഞപേക്ഷിച്ചപ്പോൾ ‘നിന്റെ മകളുടെ വിവാഹം മുടങ്ങുന്നതിൽ ഞാൻ എന്തിനാടാ വേദനിക്കുന്നത്?’ എന്നു തിരിച്ചുചോദിച്ചെന്നും പറയുന്നു. ഇതിനിടെ വാൻ ഡ്രൈവറെ പൊലീസുകാർ പറഞ്ഞുവിട്ടു. 
അൽപസമയത്തിനുശേഷം കേസ് സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ ഒതുക്കിത്തീർക്കുന്നതിന്റെ ‘ചിട്ടവട്ടങ്ങൾ’ ആണു ഹക്കീം കേട്ടത്. സ്റ്റേഷനിലെ പൊലീസുകാരെല്ലാം അതേക്കുറിച്ചു സംസാരിച്ചു.രാത്രി 11.45ന് ആണു മറ്റു ബന്ധുക്കളെ വിട്ടയച്ചത്. രാവിലെ ഹക്കീമിനെയും മറ്റു രണ്ടുപേരെയും കോടതിയിൽ ഹാജരാക്കി. 20 വരെ റിമാൻഡ് ചെയ്തു.തിങ്കൾ, വ്യാഴം ദിവസങ്ങളിൽ സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ പോയി ഒപ്പിടണമെന്നാണു ജാമ്യ വ്യവസ്ഥ. ഹക്കീം വ്യാഴാഴ്ച സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ എത്തിയപ്പോൾ അരമണിക്കൂർ വൈകിയിരുന്നു. ഗതാഗതക്കുരുക്കിൽപെട്ടുവെന്നു പറഞ്ഞപ്പോൾ എസ്ഐ തട്ടിക്കയറി.ഹക്കീമിന്റെ വീഴ്ചകൊണ്ടാണു വൈകിയതെന്നതു മൊഴിയായി രേഖപ്പെടുത്തി ഒപ്പിട്ടുവാങ്ങാൻ എസ്ഐ നിർദേശിച്ചുവത്രെ. ഹക്കീം തയാറാകാത്തതിനെ തുടർന്ന് പൊലീസുകാർ വളഞ്ഞു – ഒടുവിൽ നിവൃത്തിയില്ലാതെ ഒപ്പിട്ടുകൊടുക്കുകയായിരുന്നു..ഹക്കിമീന്റെ ജാമ്യം റദ്ദാക്കണമെന്നാണു നെടുമങ്ങാട് കോടതിയിൽ പൊലീസ് ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടിരിക്കുന്നത്. 
ജീവിതത്തിൽ ഒരു കേസിലും പെടാത്ത ഹക്കിമിന്റെ ദുർവിധി ആർക്കും ഉണ്ടാകാതിരിക്കട്ടേ. ഒരു കോൺസറ്റബിൾ വിചാരിച്ചാൽ പോലും കേരള ഭരണത്തേ നാറ്റിക്കാം എന്നായി അവസ്ഥ. മാന്യതയും നീതിയും അംശം പോലും ജീവിതത്തിലും സർവീസിലും തൊട്ട് തീണ്ടിയിട്ടില്ലാത്ത പോലീസുകാരാണിത് ചെയ്യുന്നത്. ക്രൂരതയുടെ പര്യായവും. ഈ നെറികേട് പരമാവധി ഷേർ ചെയ്യൂ പ്രതികരിക്കൂ ",malayalam

The UDF staged a walkout later, alleging the government's lack of effective intervention in the matter, even as PWD minister G Sudhakaran, on behalf of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan , maintained that the law and order situation in the state was 'secure'. 

Pointing to the murder of a former radio jockey at nearby Madavoor yesterday, Opposition leader in the assembly Ramesh Chennithala said goons and quotation gangs were unleashing widespread violence in the state, causing a fear psychosis among the people. 

He also alleged that police, who are supposed to ensure protection to the life and property of people, were working in tandem with the anti-social elements in many cases. 

The ""politicisation"" of the police force and lack of effective interventions and follow-up action by the government had resulted in the goons having a free run, he said. 

""All goons and quotation gangs are getting political protection in the state now,"" Chennithala said. 

Mentioning about the mandatory training imparted to police yesterday to improve their professional behvariour, he said the ""police highhandedness"" was continuing even after the 'tution class' by the DGP. 

However, Sudhakaran rejected the opposition charges and said the police force was one of the best in the country and had won many awards and accolades for its efficiency. 

""The government has taken effective steps to rein in goons, loan sharks and other anti-social elements. Some isolated incidents are happening. But the law and order situation in the state is secure,"" he said. 

Over 400 cases had been registered under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities Prevention Act (KAPA) after the LDF government came to power and over 200 cases were registered under 'Operation Kubera', a drive against loan sharks, last year, he said. 

Though the minister admitted that there was 'criminalisation' in the police, he said the government's effort was to bring in change in this trend. 

He also informed the House that a special investigation team was set up to probe the murder of the ex-raido jockey and folk singer, Rajesh and the culprits would be nabbed soon. 

Seeking notice for the adjournment motion over the issue, K Muraleedharan (Congress) said criminal activities were becoming a continuing saga in the state. 

Police, who acted as protectors on one side, were becoming 'arachars' (hangmen) on the other side, he added. 

The Opposition staged a walkout after Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan disallowed the motion and took up other business of the day. LGK UD APR APR APR 0 Comments",english

The bill suggesting revision of salaries and allowances was based on the recommendation of Justice (retd) J.M. James Commission. The last revision was made in 2012. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Assembly has passed a bill proposing to nearly double the salaries and allowances of ministers, MLAs, the speaker, deputy speaker, leader of opposition, and chief whip with effect from 1 April. 
With the revision, the salaries and allowances of ministers and others would increase to Rs90,500 from Rs 55,000 and that of MLAs from Rs39,500 to Rs70,000. 
The bill suggesting revision of salaries and allowances was based on the recommendation of Justice (retd) J.M. James Commission. The last revision was made in 2012. 
“During the last five years, prices of all commodities, including petrol, diesel, electricity have increased manifold,” the bill, which was adopted on Tuesday, stated in its statement of Objects and Reasons. 
As per the revision, the constituency allowances of ministers will go up from Rs12,000 to Rs40,000 per month and that of legislators, from Rs12,000 per month to Rs25,000. 
The bill introduced a new provision for air travel allowance to MLAs for travel inside and outside the state, with a cap of Rs50,000 per year for attending assembly committee meetings. 
With regard to the financial implication of the revision, the bill stated that Kerala would incur an additional recurring expenditure of approximately Rs5.25 crore per year. 
A separate bill to increase the pension amount of former MLAs by Rs1,000 was also adopted. The maximum pension to which a member is eligible in the aggregate was fixed at Rs50,000 per month from the existing Rs35,000.

Over the weekend, the Ram Navami celebrations in Bengal descended into the mayhem of murder and rioting. As per reports , a policeman got his hand chopped off. 
Brutal! 
I do not know the specific facts of this situation. This article is not about that. Rather this article is about the reaction on social media to the violence in Bengal. Not surprisingly, most people on social media were angry and disturbed about the situation. 
This article is about dissecting that sentiment. Sadly, there are some truths about Bengal that people from outside the state need to know. I am sorry I don’t have good news to deliver. 
Broadly speaking, the reaction on social media contained the following two themes: 
(1) A sense of outrage over the violence in Bengal. 
(2) A sense of shock over the violence in Bengal. 
Now, the outrage part I totally agree with. But the shock part. I wish I could share your sentiment. 
To a Bengali, here is what your shock and surprise over political violence in Bengal sounds like: You sound like someone who has landed in Europe in 1944 and is surprised to see so much violence around. Did you not know there was a World War raging since 1939? 
So this article is intended as a primer for those from outside Bengal. The state of West Bengal hasn’t caught fire *now*, it has been burning for decades. You just didn’t know about it. Because the establishment could never find a way to blame BJP and Hindutva groups for Bengal’s political violence, they never told you about it. 
But now that BJP has become a force to reckon with in Bengal, I expect you to hear more and more about the state in the coming days. 
So, here is a short list of stories of political violence from Bengal that you never heard because the establishment media hid it from you. Read on if you dare. 
In 1997, on the floor of West Bengal Assembly, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, then the Home Minister in the state, admitted that there had been 28,000 political murders between 1977-1996. 
Shocked? We are just getting started. 
That’s 1500 political murders a year or about 4 political dissenters that were murdered per day. Per. Day. 
In Bengal, dissent was not just dangerous. In Bengal, dissent was death itself. The consequence of “dissent” was not getting trolled on Facebook or Twitter, followed by an instant celebrity status on the Thinkfest circuit. Dissent meant death. 
You just never heard of it. Because for media and intellectuals and academics, there was no BJP to blame in Bengal until now. The river of blood had to be ignored. 
Did I say ‘blood?’ My mistake. 
In many cases, there was no blood. A former CPIM MP disclosed that Pinarayi Vijayan, now the Hon. CM of Kerala had once exhorted his comrades to adopt the ‘Bengal model.’ 
The ‘Bengal model’ consisted of picking up political dissenters and burying them alive with a sack of salt. See? No blood! 
Sometimes, of course, there was blood. That is when the comrades would enter the house of a political rival, cut their bodies open and then make their mother eat the rice soaked in the blood of her sons. 
I warned you before. The story of Bengal is not to be read by the faint of heart. 
There is this famous landmark in Calcutta called “Bijon Setu.” I know it well. As a child, I would cross it often when we went to Calcutta for summer vacations at my grandmother’s house. 
As an adult, I learned about what had happened at Bijon Setu. One fine morning in 1982, seventeen people (monks and nuns of the Ananda Marga sect) were burned alive on that big bridge in Calcutta in broad daylight. No arrest was ever made, of course. 
How many such famous landmarks in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal are witnesses to forgotten massacres? 
Here’s another. You may have heard of Jadavpur University. A great institution. Pride of all Bengalis. But you may not have heard the name Gopal Sen. He was one of the Vice-Chancellors of the university. One time he took a stand against an examination boycott called by Communist students. 
Vice-Chancellor Gopal Sen was murdered , then and there, right on the campus of Jadavpur University. 
Now you know why I am never fooled by liberal claims that Communist students at JNU are harmless children. Because I have been to Bengal. 
I must apologize. I shouldn’t imply that Communists murdered the VC of Jadavpur University. Despite the murder happening on a well-populated campus, there were absolutely no witnesses and no leads for the police. It remains a complete and total mystery who murdered the Vice Chancellor in front of literally hundreds of people. 
In 1993, there was a protest march to the famous Writers’ Building in Calcutta, home of the State Secretariat. There, right in the heart of Calcutta, the police opened fire and 13 people were killed on the spot. Mamata Banerjee must remember this incident rather well. After all, she was the one leading the procession. 
This is the level of political violence that has been the norm in Bengal. Sometimes dissenters were buried alive, sometimes they were murdered and their blood was fed to their mothers. Sometimes, as in Marichjhapi , thousands of people were rounded up on an island in the Sunderbans, cut off from food and water for weeks and then the armed police would march in, massacre everybody and throw their bodies into the surrounding water. 
Feeling numb yet? Just remember that all these big intellectuals and media houses, who track the minute to minute availability of Tunday Kabab in local Lucknow restaurants, never told you these stories. 
Welcome to Bengal, where blood is cheaper than water. 
And by the way, still feeling angry about that Lenin statue in Tripura? It goes without saying that what happens in Tripura is a corollary of Bengal politics. 
My appeal to you is to stand up and question these intellectuals and the deliberate, dishonest silence they have maintained all these years. Take Rajdeep Sardesai, a well-known master of “political context.” He says that you don’t need to cover with intensity the murder of Bajrang Dal worker Prashant Poojary in Karnataka in 2015 because the murder had a “political context.” Go ask him whether the fall of Lenin statue in Tripura can be similarly “contextualized” and forgotten. 
These people that were ruthlessly massacred in Bengal were your fellow citizens. Their stories deserve to be heard. And I dare say their stories deserve to be heard before we worry about a statue. Ask those who claim to be doing the “Journalism of Courage” why the story of political violence in Bengal was never a part of the ‘national mainstream’ until now. 
For me, one of the most ironic moments was this recent bit on ABP News. In this, both the ABP news reporter and the anchor in the studio are worried that BJP’s Sunil Deodhar might be making unfounded baseless allegations about a skeleton being found in Manik Sarkar’s house back in 2005. 
Which is weird, because the discovery of the skeleton was never in dispute; it was an accepted fact as reported by the Telegraph here . This is even more ironic when you realize that ABP group actually owns The Telegraph. 
So what happened? Why was ABP News wondering whether the discovery of the skeleton was a baseless allegation? 
I’ll tell you what most likely happened. Neither the ABP anchor nor the ABP reporter could believe that such an explosive piece of news could have remained practically unknown for so many years. A skeleton, allegedly that of a minor girl, found in a Chief Minister’s house? No way that media would have ignored such a piece of news. Except it did. 
Indeed, our news media is compromised to such an extent that even the individuals in the media can sometimes fail to imagine how corrupt it is. Related News ",english

Marx, chairman, NCHRO, (Centre) along with Reny Ayline, National Secretary, and Adv. Ansar Indori, national executive member, releasing the fact finding report in a joint Press conference held at New Delhi. 
New Delhi, March 27, 2018 (Pervez Bari): A Fact Finding Committee of NCHRO, (National Confederation of Human Rights Organisation), which visited Jharkhand on March 23 and 24 in its Fact Finding Report has demanded a judicial enquiry into arrests of innocent adivasi youths in large numbers in Jhakhand. The NCHRO has urged the National Human Rights Commission, (NHRC0, and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, (NCST), that it should take note of these arrests and take necessary action against the state government. 
In a joint Press conference held at New Delhi on Monday Prof. A. Marx, chairman, NCHRO, Reny Ayline, National Secretary, and Adv. Ansar Indori, national executive member, who were members of the Fact Finding Committee which visited Jharkhand, shared their experience and released the report on the occasion. The NCHRO team members met some of the organization leaders, relatives of the people in jail and some social activists and spoke to them on the real situation that prevails now in Jharkhand. 
The NCHRO’s Fact Finding Committee in its report has included other demands which are: (a) The illegal ban on PFI and MSS should be immediately lifted and those arrested in related cases just to justify these bans should be released and the cases against them should be immediately withdrawn. List of the people arrested in related cases are 1. Themhirdur Rahman (PFI) 2. Ubairdur Rahman (PFI) 3. Ajay Hembrum (MSS) 4. Mohan Murmu (MSS) 5. Daya Chand Hembrum (MSS) 6. Damodar Turi (Vistapan). (b) The draconian British imperial Law CLA 1908 should be immediately repealed. (c) All the under trial prisoners should be released on bail immediately and a special court to be formed to dispose their cases. 
Meanwhile, it may be mentioned here that the present BJP Government in Jharkhand had arrested more than 4000 persons mostly adivasis for their participation in people’s movements and also had banned many organizations fighting for the rights of the people. Recently two such movements Mazdoor Sangathan Samiti, (MSS), and Popular Front of India, (PFI), were banned. 
MSS is a registered labour organization functioning in the mining and industrial areas in Jharkhand with more than 20,000 miners as its members from 1985 onwards. It is fighting for the rights of the workers. While PFI is also a registered organization functioning from 2006 onwards in almost all southern states and also in some states in North and East in the country. 
For the past two years the BJP government had been threatening to ban PFI. On February 15 2018 the Union Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju said that the Kerala government has sought a ban on the PFI. The next day the Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan refuted the statement saying that they never sought a ban on any organization including PFI. The next day the minister said that the DGP of Kerala had spoken about such a ban in the annual DGPs conference. However, this was also refuted from the office of the DGP, Kerala. In this background on February 22, 2018 the Raguber Das government ruling Jharkand announced the ban on PFI. 
Both of these organizations are banned by invoking Section 16 of the draconian Criminal Amendment Act, (CLA), which gives power to the government to ban any organization. However, the BJP government ruling Jharkhand said that PFI is influenced by IS and some of its members had joined in it. But the government has not given any proof for its statement. 
The Fact Finding Committee members met and spoke in Jharkhand people which included Fr. Stan Swami of ‘Bagacha’, movement fighting for the rights of the tribals, Debi w/o Damodhar Puri, the activist now arrested after the ban on MSS, Nadeem Khan, a CPI (ML) activist, Tridip Gosh, a retired engineer and HR activist, Hanzla Sheikh, state vice president of the banned PFI, and many others.",english

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Assembly on Wednesday witnessed a noisy protest by Opposition UDF over what it called the 'continuous' absence of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the House during the ongoing Budget Session. 
Vijayan, who is in New Delhi on Wednesday to take part in the CPM central committee meeting, did not attend the House on Monday also. File image of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Getty images 
Opposition Congress-led UDF members stood up asking 'Where is the chief minister?"" when PWD minister G Sudhakaran replied on behalf of Vijayan during the zero hour. 
Though both Sudhakaran and Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan said the chief minister had informed the business advisory committee of the legislature that he would be away today, the Opposition continued the protest. 
UDF members said Vijayan, who holds the Home portfolio, skipped the session on Monday also when a notice for a motion was moved on the ""highhandedness"" of police. 
He was present only for some time in the Assembly on Tuesday, they said during the brief protest. 
Seeking to move a notice for an adjournment motion on the atrocities by goons and mafia gangs, K Muraleedharan (Congress) asked whether Vijayan was following the 'model' of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he alleged, used to skip Parliament sessions. 
The MLA said the chief minister, who gave a miss to the Assembly session, had taken part in a programme of CITU, the trade union outfit of the Left party, on Monday. 
He wanted to know whether the Central Committee meeting and CITU programme were more important to Vijayan than the Assembly session. 
Sharing his party colleague's sentiments, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said though the chief minister was busy, he should realise the significance of attending Assembly sessions. 
However, Sudhakaran refuted the Opposition charges and said Vijayan was a ""model"" chief minister who had participated the maximum number of days in the assembly proceedings. 
He justified the chief minister attending party Central Committee meeting.

More than 1 lakh Kerala kids claim no caste/religious identity | C. Raveendranath | V.T. Balram | M.B. Rajesh | Caste | religion | Kerala | secularism | Pinarayi Vijayan | CPI(M),"By Cithara Paul March 28, 2018 Kerala Education Minister C. Raveendranath with a group of children | C. Raveendranath's Facebook account 
True to its secular credentials, more than 1 lakh students in Kerala have preferred not to fill the caste/religious column in school admission forms. 
This figure was revealed by Education Minister C. Raveendranath on Wednesday in the Assembly. “As many as 1,24,147 students in the state have opted to leave their caste/religious column blank,'' the minister said. This figure covers students from first standard to 12th. 
“This figure is proof to the secular texture of Kerala society,” he said. 
According to officials in the education department, this figure only includes the students in government and aided schools. “We were aware of the fact. But, frankly, we did not expect this huge a figure,” said the official. 
According to him, this figure would make Kerala rank at top with students of secular background. 
“Nowhere else, except may be Tamil Nadu, one will get to see this kind of figure. This certainly reflects the secular bent of mind of Kerala parents,” the official said. 
According to him, the education department had recorded similar figures a few years back. “But the number was nowhere near this one (the present figure),” he said. 
The official said the government also plans to take details from private schools to get a larger understanding. 
“But the fact Kerala has these many secular students in government/aided schools itself is a good trend as the state has a strong public education system,'' said the official. Last year, the number of students who got enrolment in government/aided schools had witnessed a steep increase. 
The fact that political leaders, cutting across the political spectrum, had been championing the cause by not filling the religious column while seeking admission for their wards may also have helped, averred the official. 
The decision of Congress MLA V.T. Balram and CPI(M) MP M.B. Rajesh to leave the religious column blank was widely discussed in various forums last year. Both had announced their decisions on their respective Facebook pages, garnering many likes. 
“I have written 'no' in the column for religion and caste. I am proud of the fact,'' Rajesh had written on his Facebook page. 
Similarly, Balram had said that he and his wife decided to leave the column blank as they did not want to impose any religion on their child. “When he is an adult, he is free to choose his religion,” the Congress MLA had said. 
Responding to the new figures, Rajesh told THE WEEK, “It is a very heartening figure"" in the current context. ""That's so many people uphold the spirit of the Constitution in its true sense in Kerala is a great thing,"" he said. 
Many who wrote on the FB pages of these leaders appreciating them had said that it's time for all to take a leaf out of these leaders' book. 
Many have indeed, it seems. TAGS ",english

നേരത്തെ 59 പദ്ധതികളെക്കുറിച്ച് ചർച്ച ചെയ്തിരുന്നെങ്കിലും മൂന്നെണ്ണത്തിന് മാത്രമാണ് അംഗീകാരം ലഭിച്ചത്. 192 കിലോമീറ്റർ റോഡ് നിർമ്മിക്കാൻ നിർദേശമുണ്ടെങ്കിലും 18 കിലോമീറ്റർ നിർമ്മിക്കാൻ മാത്രമാണ് അംഗീകാരം കിട്ടിയത്. ഈ തീരുമാനം പുന:പരിശോധിക്കണമെന്ന് കേന്ദ്രമന്ത്രിയോട് ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടു. ദേശീയ ജലപാതയുടെ ഭൂമി ഏറ്റെടുക്കൽ സംബന്ധിച്ചുള്ള കാര്യങ്ങളും മന്ത്രിയുടെ ശ്രദ്ധയിൽപ്പെടുത്തിയെന്നും, ഇക്കാര്യങ്ങൾ വിശദമാക്കിയ നിവേദനങ്ങൾ അദ്ദേഹത്തിന് കൈമാറിയെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി വ്യക്തമാക്കി. കേന്ദ്രമന്ത്രി നിതിൻ ഗഡ്കരിയുമായി നടത്തിയ ചർച്ച പോസീറ്റിവായിരുന്നെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞു.",malayalam

കണ്ണൂർ: കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ പറക്കുന്നത് വയൽക്കിളികളല്ലെന്നും രാഷ്ട്രീയ കിളികളാണെന്നും സാഹിത്യകാരൻ എം മുകുന്ദൻ. കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ രാഷ്ട്രീയ ഇടപെടലിനെ വിമ‍ർശിക്കുകയായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം. ബിജെപി ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ളവർ കീഴാറ്റൂർ സമരത്തെ ഹൈജാക്ക് ചെയ്തെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞു. രാഷ്ട്രീയമായ മുതലെടുപ്പിന് വേണ്ടിയുള്ള സമരമാണ് അവിടെ നടക്കുന്നതെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം വ്യക്തമാക്കി. ബിജെപിയുടെ കളികൾ പറക്കുന്ന സ്ഥലത്ത് നമ്മുടെ മനസ്സ് പോയി നിൽക്കില്ലെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറയുന്നു. 
വയൽക്കിളികളുമായി ചർച്ച ചെയ്ത് പ്രശ്നം പരിഹരിക്കുകയാണ് വേണ്ടത്. സര്‍ക്കാരിന് ചില പിടിവാശികള്‍ കാണും പക്ഷേ ഇത് ഒരു പിടിവാശിയുടെ പ്രശ്നമല്ല. കീഴാറ്റൂര്‍ സമരം ഒരു പ്രതീക്തമകമാണ്. ഇനി വരാന്‍ പോകുന്ന പരിസ്ഥിതി സമരങ്ങളിലെല്ലാം കീഴാറ്റൂര്‍ സമരത്തിന്റെ ഓര്‍മ പൊന്തിവരും. ഇത് വളരെ നിര്‍ണായകമായ ഒന്നാണെന്നും എം മുകുന്ദൻ പറഞ്ഞു. സമരത്തെ പൈങ്കിളി വൽക്കരിച്ചു 
പരിസ്ഥിതി പ്രശ്നത്തെ പൈങ്കിളിവൽക്കരുത്. ചൈനയിലും ഹരിയാനയിലുമൊക്കെ എങ്ങിനെ റോഡുകളുണ്ടായെന്ന് വയൽക്കിളികൾക്ക് പറഞ്ഞുകൊടുക്കണമെന്നും സാഹിത്യകാരൻ എം മുകുന്ദൻ വ്യക്തമാക്കി. നെൽ വയലുകൾ നകത്തി തളിപ്പറമ്പിൽ ബൈപ്പാസ് വരുന്നതിനെതിരെയാണ് വയൽക്കിളികൾ സമരം ആരംഭിച്ചത്. സമരത്തിന്റെ ഒന്നാം ഘട്ടം അവസനിക്കുമ്പോൾ കേരളം കീഴാറ്റൂരലേക്ക് എന്ന മുദ്രാവാക്യം ഉയർത്തി നൂറുകണക്കിന് ആളുകൾ കീഴാറ്റൂരിലേക്ക് മാർച്ച് സംഘടിപ്പിച്ചിരുന്നു. ഇതിൽ കോൺഗ്രസ്, ബിജെപി അടക്കമുള്ള രാഷ്ട്രീയ നേതാക്കളും പങ്കെടുത്തിരുന്നു. വിവിധ ജില്ലകളിൽ നിന്നെത്തിയ പരിസ്ഥിതി പ്രവർത്തകരും കോൺഗ്രസ് നേതാവ് വിഎം സുധീരൻ, പിസി ജോർജ്, സുരേഷ് ഗേപി എംപി, ആം ആദ്മി നേതാവി സിആർ നീലകണ്ഠൻ, ആർഎംപി നേതാക്കൾ തുടങ്ങിയവർ മാർച്ചിൽ പങ്കെടുത്തിരുന്നു. സമരം ബിജെപി ഹൈജാക്ക് ചെയ്തു 
കീഴാറ്റൂർ സമരം ബീജെപി ഹൈജാക്ക് ചെയ്തെന്ന ആരോപണവുമായി സമര സമിതിയിലെ ചിലർ തന്നെ രൂക്ഷ വിമർശനവുമായി രംഗത്തെത്തിയിരുന്നു. ഇതിനു പിന്നാലെയാണ് സാഹിത്യകാരൻ എം മുകുന്ദനും ഇതേ ആരോപണം ഉന്നയിക്കുന്നത്. അതേസമയം ബൈപ്പാസ് നിർമ്മിക്കണമെന്ന കാര്യത്തിൽ ഉറച്ച് ‌തന്നെയാണ് സിപിഎമ്മും നിൽക്കുന്നത്. വയലിലൂടെ കടന്നുപോകുന്ന ഒരുകിലോമീറ്ററോളം ദൂരത്തിൽ എലിവേറ്റഡ് ഹൈവേ (ആകാശപ്പാത) ആകാമെന്നു പാർട്ടി നിലപാട് മയപ്പെടുത്തിയിട്ടുമുണ്ട്. ബൈപാസിനെതിരെ സമരം ചെയ്യുന്നവരെ ഒറ്റപ്പെടുത്തണമെന്നാവശ്യപ്പെട്ടു സിപിഎം കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ സിപിഎം ശക്തി പ്രകടനവും നടത്തിിയിരുന്നു. ‘വികസനത്തിനായി ഭൂമി വിട്ടുകൊടുക്കാൻ സമ്മതമാണ്'

State Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, deputising for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, said that a team of four police officials are working on the case and it’s going on in the right direction. The incident occurred in the capital city’s outskirts. Rajesh was in his studio after performing at a local show near his village when a group of men burst in and hacked him to death. His friend was also attacked and is now convalescing at the Medical College hospital here. Police have found that the four killers came in a red car and while three of them barged into the studio of Rajesh around 2 a.m on Tuesday, one person remained in the car. ALSO READ: Standing banned in Kerala luxury buses While tight-lipped about the progress of the probe, police however have made certain breakthroughs in breaking the case and have found out that he was speaking to a woman whom he knew when he worked in the Middle East, when he was attacked. It was the woman, who on hearing the shouts of Rajesh, informed his friends about the attack. Rajesh started his career with a leading FM radio here. After a brief stint in the Middle East, he has been making programmes on his own. The Congress-led opposition blamed the Kerala Police for erring in their duty and said the root cause of the deteriorating law and order situation in the state is due to the Pinarayi Vijayan government politicising the police force.",english

Moving an adjournment motion on what he said was the deteriorating law and order situation, Congress leader K. Muraleedharan urged Speaker P.

The Speaker too pointed out that the Chief Minister had on Tuesday informed the business advisory committee of the legislature that he would be away in Delhi. Muraleedharan said there were rising incidents of crime because police were not doing what they should be doing. ",english

It was searing account of the attack on the native peoples of his continent by the power elites who had commandeered it. An Indian economist nourished by the idea of the liberating impact on the country of the Green Revolution and conscious of the role of the policies of the Nehru era in ending over a century of stagnation under colonialism, I had not given it much importance at that time. So it came as surprise to read of events in a corner of Kerala that corresponded quite closely, albeit on a far smaller scale, to what Escobar was alluding to. Keezhattur’s case 
In the village of Keezhattur in Kerala’s Kannur district, a section of farmers is holding out against the announced, but yet to be implemented, acquisition of their farm land. This is to enable a bypass for the national highway that already exists. Long-cultivated farmland is to be layered over with concrete to construct a motorable road. The farmers agitating against the acquisition have come together under the banner Vayalkillikal which translates to ‘birds of the field’, flagging the assault on nature that it represents. They speak not only of the economic loss that the acquisition means to them but their opposition to the loss of habitat, water sources and other natural capital that they value for its own sake. 
Two aspects pertaining to the situation must be stated at the outset. First, not all the farmers are unwilling to sell their land. Second, there is a strong presence of a political party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M), which is not only aggressively abetting the land acquisition but also attempting to break the opposition to it. No action has been left uncontemplated. The samara pandal , a temporary shelter from the heat, erected at the site by the farmers agitating against the takeover was burned down and the house of Suresh, their leader, was stoned at night by goons who made a cowardly getaway on motorcycles. That the opponents of the agitation are members of the CPI(M), which rules Kerala today, gives them an unfair advantage. Under the circumstances it must take immense courage to just mount an agitation. The Malayalam media is often not just close to but actually part of the political establishment. High economic rewards are said to be associated with managing the transfer of the land to the final builder and there is the ever-present threat of violence. The present State government has not shown itself to be sympathetic to those who wish to hold out. It has not even publicly asked that peace be maintained, leave alone restrain its cadres on the ground. All this is of a piece with the general attitude of the CPI(M) towards those who oppose its plans. It was observed at Nandigram, West Bengal in 2007 when the government of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had tried to acquire farm land to be handed over to an Indonesian chemical firm. When alternatives exist 
Is it absolutely necessary to build a bypass through the paddy fields of Keezhattur? By at least one account it is not. The Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad, which as its name suggests is a body devoted to bringing scientific reasoning to bear on public issues, has presented to the Kerala government an alternative. This involves building an elevated expressway that would leave the paddy fields of Keezhattur undamaged. The government must treat this proposal with seriousness and educate the public on all aspects of the issue. The point to note is that a north-south highway across Kerala already exists. For a State that is not particularly wide, the coverage of this existing road should be deemed good enough given the environmental damage that a new one would entail. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) responsible for highway construction in the country ought to be sensitive to both the geographies of the different regions and the aspirations of the people who populate them. Insistence on a national standard for our highways is a form of dogmatism. It makes little sense to insist on roads of the same specification in Kerala with its fragile ecology of laterite formations and scattered population and the less densely populated alluvial plains of northern India. We should aim at the highest attainable quality of road across the country but cut according to the lay of the land. 
At Keezhattur the local CPI(M) cadres have dubbed the protest against the land acquisition as ‘anti-development’. This is proclaimed on billboards at periodical intervals leading up to the fields all the way from the main road. It is abject propaganda. The agitating farmers have categorically stated that they are not against roads, only that they wish to avoid to the destruction of not just cropland but an entire ecosystem that encompasses the Western Ghats, the hillocks and food-producing wetlands. They have also stated a moral responsibility to future generations. 
While much of this might appear mere sentimentality to the hard-boiled economist, even he is likely to ask the straight question: What awaits those who reach the northern extremity of the State once this bypass has been built? This is not been asked yet, leave alone answered. Keezhattur is already close to a highway to which there is a motorable road, though perhaps a somewhat narrow one. And a narrower access to the highway is the price you would have to pay if you want to conserve natural capital, and a set of farmers has already indicated that they are ready to pay the price. But maybe even the farmers are not morally entitled to take the final call in this matter. There is always the greater common good to be reckoned with that limits the claims of private ownership. We are all only trustees of the natural world. The paddy fields of Keezhattur are the commonwealth of the people of India to be preserved as a source of food, for which by the way a road is not a substitute. Also Read The Chief Minister’s call 
It is indeed difficult to read the mind of the Pinarayi Vijayan government on this matter. It has remained aloof when it has not been disingenuous in its response. The Home Minister has said that the State government is merely responding to the demands of the NHAI. Well, it must not do so passively. It must not grant consent to the project in its present form. At a uniquely non-party political rally held at Keezhattur on March 25 Suresh Gopi, Rajya Sabha member from Kerala, said that he had spoken to the national leadership of his party, the BJP, and that they are by no means adamant on the issue. Further, in an extraordinary gesture he offered to “touch the feet” of the Chief Minister to seek a review of the present plan. Everything — economics, natural conservation and concern for food production in a State where paddy cultivation could become extinct if current trends continue — points to the need for statesmanship on the part of Mr. Vijayan. He could listen to his party members and, wielding state power, win the battle against an unarmed group of agitators or he could hear the birds of the field at Keezhattur and win the hearts and minds of his people.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that he did not wish to make any further comment on the dispute over construction of a national highway bypass at Keezhattur. Mr. Vijayan, who was speaking to reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday, pointed out that he had expressed his views on the subject several times over. 
The Chief Minister also made it clear that he had not discussed the subject with Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari. 
His talks with the Union Minister, the Chief Minister said, was about the dispute between the State government and the Centre on compensation proposed by the State for the land sought to be acquired for developing the National Highway from Thalappady to Neeleswaram in Kasaragod. 
Centre feels compensation higher 
The Central government was of the view that the compensation proposed by Kerala was on the higher side.

The decision has been taken keeping in view of the shortage of surface water and ground water in these regions.
A meeting of the state disaster management authority was convened under the chairmanship of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to review the drought situation . In the meeting, the reports from the nine districts facing acute shortage of drinking water , were presented.
Alappuzha, Kannur, Idukki, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Wayanad are the nine districts, which have been declared as drought hit. Specific instructions have been given to the disaster relief commissioner to take steps for effective management and responsiveness to minimize the impact of the drought.
At the meeting it was observed that the districts declared drought hit have been facing severe shortage of rain water, surface water and ground water. Moreover, the level of salt water in these districts has been rising.
“The main concern was the acute shortage of drinking water, for which specific instructions have been given to tackle the situation,’’ said Sekhar Kuriakose , member secretary of disaster management authority.
He said adequate funds would be provided for the local bodies for providing the supply of drinking water. Already, the government has sanctioned funds for drinking water supply to the local bodies. If it turns out to be insufficient, the authority would sanction additional funds.
The national meteorological department had already issued a warning on possible drinking water shortages in these nine districts due to the rain shortfall in 2017. The department had reported that the north-east monsoon was considerably weak in these districts.
In the case of Idukki, it does not face a drought situation presently but things could turn worse due to the shortage of water in the water bodies in hilly areas.
The authorities have warned of a possible shortage in drinking water if the situation worsens. Hence, the disaster management authority decided to include the district also in the list.",english

1 day ago | Mar 29, 2018 | IANS Thiruvananthapuram, March 28 : The Kerala government on Wednesday informed the assembly that the murder of young former radio jockey that took place Tuesday is being probed by a special investigation team. State Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, deputising for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, said that a team of four police officials are working on the case and it's going on in the right direction. The incident occurred in the capital city's outskirts. Rajesh was in his studio after performing at a local show near his village when a group of men burst in and hacked him to death. His friend was also attacked and is now convalescing at the Medical College hospital here. Police have found that the four killers came in a red car and while three of them barged into the studio of Rajesh around 2 a.m on Tuesday, one person remained in the car. While tight-lipped about the progress of the probe, police however have made certain breakthroughs in breaking the case and have found out that he was speaking to a woman whom he knew when he worked in the Middle East, when he was attacked. It was the woman, who on hearing the shouts of Rajesh, informed his friends about the attack. Rajesh started his career with a leading FM radio here. After a brief stint in the Middle East, he has been making programmes on his own. The Congress-led opposition blamed the Kerala Police for erring in their duty and said the root cause of the deteriorating law and order situation in the state is due to the Pinarayi Vijayan government politicising the police force.",english

maryashakil Updated: March 28, 2018, 11:59 PM IST The BJP has been trying hard to expand their footprint in South India. CNN-News18's Marya Shakil talks to the man tasked with that objective, Ram Madhav , who talks about the accusations that the Centre was financially discriminating against southern states in favour of the northern ones, the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh, the Lingayat question in Karnataka and much more. You had a meeting with Financial Commission chairman NK Singh. Is BJP worried that an anti-south party tag is hurting it? My meeting with chairman of 15th financial commission was about new terms of reference, handed down to commission by President of India. We had talked about the issue that 2011 census is going to be basis for population growth, we had reservations about that, because we thought it will do injustice to progressive states. Progressive states, not just in south India, in other parts as well. Don’t want to take their names for political reasons, but I know for sure that taking the 2011 census as basis for 15th Finance Commission will cause some difficulty to some states that have focused so much in the sphere of population regulation in the last 30 years. Earlier the 1971 census was used so we basically wanted to know is now what is the reality from him (NK Singh). What we are reading in papers is true or not. He reassured us that planning commission wouldn’t do any injustice to our state and progressive states will get their share. How are you looking at statement of Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, who has accused the Centre of discriminating against states ? This is all politics over whatever is available to them. The 15th Finance Commission will start its work later this year, maybe next month. It will not submit work to this government but next one which will come to power in 2019. This mean Siddaramaiah thinks that in 2019 also, there will be a BJP government, which it will be. But our larger issue is that all states should get justice. What about this argument that balance of fiscal power is shifting to northern states that are less productive, while southern states contribute much more? This is all fear politicking... trying to divide country. Right now you’re going geographically where you are trying to create artificial divide between south & north when it doesn’t exist. As I said, progressive states are there in all parts of country, I’m not demeaning other states. They have all achieved certain benchmarks. People like Siddaramaiah, for their sheer political ends, are trying to create artificial divide between north & south. It doesn’t exist. CM of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, has supported Siddaramaiah. He has asked all CMs of 5 south states to come together and unite. Birds of same feather, they will do this. These parties trying to create a rift between states and states, which is not good for us. Has the BJP been caught off guard on question of minority status to Lingayats? Now that seer of influential muth has said that he is supporting Siddaramaiah rather than supporting BJP president Amit Shah who has been in Karnataka trying to unite various muths. Our party president has made it clear that his visit was to seek blessings of Lingayat leadership, it wasn’t political visit. Whether to use such issues for political ends. Now whether or not to use such issues for political ends is for parties to use their wisdom. Although state government enjoys certain powers, for a particular community to be declared minority, should it be used as a political weapon, is something that the parties have to choose, I don’t want to say anything beyond that. The BJP is projecting Congress as anti-Hindu party calling the Lingayat religious campaign as a divisive one. Do you think it will earn dividends post May 15th? Congress party is trying to project this. They first said they are being accused of being anti-Hindu, we did not. Now they are trying very hard to prove the point. This temple hopping that’s going on is their own over-zealousness to prove themselves as pro-Hindu. As far as we are concerned, Congress has history of communalising politics, of playing appeasement politics, polarised politics, this is what we have always highlighted and will continue to highlight this character of the Congress party. But seers of these Maths are saying that such a move by Siddaramaiah would act as a unifier of Lingayats… A critical question to be looked at is something that is purely religious, if what Lingayat leaders are saying is true, should we really use it as a political weapon in elections? That’s an important question. But hasn’t BJP done that in the past? No, never for electoral purposes. We never tried to divide Hindus. Rather, we tried to create oneness, so our doing such things question doesn’t arise. We have always held that we don’t believe in appeasement politics, I’m only talking of politicising issue. If a community wants certain favours, certain status, such things have happened in the past also. Even respected organisations like Ramakrishna Mission wanted minority status in West Bengal. Those things have happened in past also, but you can’t blame BJP for playing appeasement politics. It is being said that Siddaramaiah playing by BJP's electoral playbook, he's pre-empting every electoral move of BJP, be it on question of Kannada pride, sub-nationalist identity, on the question of Hindi language… Siddaramaiah trying to play utterly divisive politics. By invoking north-south divide, by invoking anti-BJP sentiments, he is trying to use issues as emotive issues to garner votes. He is seeing defeat staring him in their face, which is why he's resorting to these techniques. What about Rahul Gandhi's charge that JD (S) is the B-team of BJP? People will laugh at it. They have seen (Congress) government with JD (S) in Karnataka, they cannot blame BJP for using JD (S) as b-team. As far as we are concerned, we are confident that we will get required numbers in Karnataka. Now that the question of minority status to Lingayats is pending with Centre, because notification has to be moved and approved by it. What is the government's stand? I don’t know, this decision taken by the cabinet and government, let’s wait. In Karnataka, Telugu people have started a campaign, they are saying BJP has betrayed people of Andhra Pradesh, they have betrayed on Andhra Pradesh reorganisation. Given that they are a substantial number in close to 20 constituencies, do you think it’ll hurt BJP? Let’s not come to conclusion that everyone in Andhra Pradesh is TDP supporter. It’s not that way, and this entire propaganda of the TDP that BJP is hurting interests of Andhra people is not bought by people of Andhra Pradesh either. People of Andhra Pradesh are getting up and questioning TDP corruption and many more things. So, to conclude (that) all of Andhra Pradesh (is) behind Telugu Desam, and then to conclude that everyone outside Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (is) supporting them is an exaggeration. We have strong leadership in Telugu speaking areas of Karnataka also, remember they are all voters of Karnataka state. For them, Karnataka's interest (is) paramount and they believe in BJP as the real party to secure interests of (the) state. Is BJP worried? Not at all, every election a challenge, we take every election very seriously. The issues, if they impact any section of voters like you are saying that sentiment in Andhra Pradesh will impact, then we take note of it and address it. The Centre says they have fulfilled their promises. Why is it that neither the YSR Congress nor the TDP believes you? These two parties are politicising the whole issue, the debate should have been centred on developmental issues. They have moved away from development to utter, sheer politics now, it's the politicization of a development discourse. For us, the state of Andhra Pradesh, a new state, it needed a lot of support from the centre. The Government of India has extended a lot of support in the last four years. Our party president has sent a detailed note in the form of a letter to the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. We have given so much, Naidu can say anything but facts cannot be denied. The letter is full of facts and figures and that cannot be denied. On the contrary, the propaganda the TDP is unleashing is full of lies. Of the 19 demands in the AP Reorganization act, one example is that of the railway zone in Vizag which has been denied by the Centre… When did we deny it? You show me one statement when we have denied it. These 19 demands were to be fulfilled in 10 years, there is a timespan for that. We have not denied the railway zone, we have not denied anything except the tag of special category state or 'special status' after the promulgation of 14th Finance Commission. The implementation of those recommendations, it has become untenable for us to extend this tag to any state except the north-eastern states. That is the only thing we said we cannot probably do and mind you, that is not part of the document of the new state creation. All other things, we are committed to fulfilling them. There are so many things that were supposed to (be) completed in 10 years, we have completed in 3 years. Those which have not been completed in 4 years, they are taking that up and they are not talking about that also, they are just talking about the tag of the special category. Our point is, as far as those 19 issues are concerned, it is a development debate. You can argue with us, you can fight with us. But they are only fighting on an emotive issue which is special category status that means that they are misleading people of Andhra Pradesh. It's not the status, it's development which is needed. It’s not sentiment that is needed. We are committed to the development of Andhra Pradesh as much as Naidu or Jaganmohan Reddy put together. Coming to the special package, TDP is saying that you will give something that will (be) equivalent to a special status, but no guidelines have been fixed till now Not true. So many rounds of discussions have happened. Since I was not part of those discussions, I am not privy to what went on. But our leaders have told us that in all these meeting(s) there were so many occasions where the AP government has agreed to take a certain package from the state and then backed off, as late as of February this year. They were supposed to come up with a new financial vehicle to take money from the centre, we are ready with Rs 9,300 crores of development money and they had agreed to take it. The only question was under which instrument they will take it, finally, they backed out. On Rs 2500 crores for development of Amravati, the Naidu government is saying that they have submitted utilisation certificates, Rs 1500 crore was for the development of capital, and Rs 1000 crores was used for the building of secretariat and roads leading to it… Fair enough, they will get all the additional money from the centre. The money that was given, that was spent, they will even get more money, they have got much more money. They are only talking about Rs 2500 crores, they have gotten many more things in those 4 years under the 14th Finance Commission. They got 42 percent of the share, from 32 to 43 percent they got a huge rise in their share of central revenues. There is a specific charge against you, that you are trying to weaken regional parties. The reason why Naidu is making this move is because you are pitting him against YSR Congress and also encouraging Pawan Kalyan in this process… First of all TDP and YSR Congress are 2 big parties, they are opposition to each other. We don’t have to pit them against each other, they are already against each other. They fought against each other in the last elections. They are two big parties, who are we to pit them against each other? So this whole 'rona dhona' is uncalled for. Is the BJP in touch with Jaganmohan Reddy? Absolutely not. These are the lies that TDP is propagating, that is the whole crux of the issue. They face a real challenge from the regional party, so in order to get out of that they are inventing issues and using lies to blame the Centre. But are you not worried that perhaps K Chandrashekar Rao and Naidu could come together and this entire perception of BJP being anti-south could gain momentum because Naidu has also said that you are collecting funds from southern states and moving it towards the north? A. Shows the level of maturity of the leaders who are making those arguments. If we go that by argument than many more such arguments will follow, someone in Rayalaseema stood up and said that in Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema is being subjected to great injustice, and Naidu was very unhappy that someone is raising the issue of Rayalaseema now. If you start dividing the country, there is no end to it. We are committed to extending our full support to Andhra Pradesh. As far as politics is concerned, Naidu was with us till one month ago, he left us before also. Now he wants to have another tent, let him go to that front. He is free, this is a democracy. is there any possibility of Naidu returning? I don't know. You should ask him, not me. There are talks of a federal front again, as we see before every election... As I said before, first of all, Mamata Banerjee was here. She was talking about the third front, we want to know what is the second front in this country. If there is already a third front, already there is a fourth front. Lunch diplomacy in Calcutta, dinner diplomacy in Delhi. We are not worried. That means for 2019, it is BJP vs all, Modi vs all? That’s a very good point you're making. It shows that the opposition, no single party today is confident enough to take on BJP, that much is clear. So holy, unholy alliances, efforts will go on. Let them try because we are here to tackle any sort of challenge. In 2019, we are going to go back to the people with Modiji as our leader and five years of our governance and its achievements. With that we're going to the people. But one partnership has actually worked in UP, BSP and SP coming together. Are you not worried? No, not at all. So many elections have happened in this very year, we have won handsomely in a number of states, end of last year we won in Himachal, Gujarat. This year, we had three governments, we have dethroned Congress in one state. One or two by-elections, they are a wakeup call for us, we will definitely try and understand what went wrong but to say that there is demoralization. etc., it is farfetched. In the North East, do you see the BJP’s growth there as an organic growth? The view is this that the north-eastern states invariably ally with the Centre... Then tell me why there was a Communist government when there was a Congress government in the Centre? Take the case of Tripura, why there was an NPF government in Nagaland when there was a Congress government in Delhi. These are arguments of losers, they want to hide their defeat in the last elections, hide their failures. They say that just because BJP is in power in Delhi, they are allying with them. BJP has done a lot of hard work on the ground, its base has expanded in the north-east. I attribute special importance to two victories, one is in Tripura and the other in Nagaland. A state of more than 95 percent Christian population today has the deputy CM from BJP, 12 MLAs in the 60 member legislature are from BJP with 16 percent vote share. Similarly is Tripura, which came from Communist parties’ stranglehold to the BJP with two third majority. In Nagaland and Meghalaya, there have been protests in the assemblies against Hindi. Are you not somewhere moving away from the cultural diversity that India stands for? First of all, there is no Hindi push. People are free to use their mother tongue, whatever language they are used to, they are free to use that. There is no push from our side. But remember Hindi is one of the important national languages of this country, our official language. So, if a particular person uses Hindi, it shouldn't be seen as somebody is imposing it on them. Where is the question of any imposition? Regarding Jammu and Kashmir, since you are in charge of the state as well, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Hansraj Ahir, said in the Lok Sabha that the government of India has no proposal of scrapping Article 370. Isn't this completely different from the stand of the BJP? Parliament questions are specific to that time. There was a question whether there was any move to scrap Article 370 before the government today, he said no, there is no such move. That does not represent any ideological position, just the position and the activity of the government on the given day. That is the reply he had to give. As far as the ideological position is concerned, in our agenda of alliance in Kashmir, we said PDP and BJP have two different positions on Article 370. These are ideological positions, but for them to materialise there needs to be a conducive atmosphere in the parliament. It is utterly wrong to interpret that our ideological position has diluted or we have shifted from that position. But as a government, what is the present status that we have to tell the country through the parliament. Let me (be) specific this time and go back to the question that I asked before, is BJP an anti-south party? Absolutely not, we were in power in Karnataka. We have been partners in the Andhra Pradesh government till 15 days ago, and we are trying to expand our footprints in the other two states also. To say that we are anti any region is an utter falsehood. South is very important for us, very dear to us. Also Watch",english

Kazhakkoottam native Harshitha said in her petition that her parents and other close relatives, who were on their way for her engagement, were harassed by the police and a false case was charged against her father.
""I have sought action against the sub-inspector and other policemen. The policemen who were supposed to protect the general public, have caused us immense mental trauma. They harassed us,"" Harshitha said.
Her father, Hakim Badaruddin said the police version to register a case against him was completely cooked up, and that he will fight for justice.
""A KSRTC bus collided with our vehicle causing damaging the mirror. A policeman, who was a member of the special branch, travelling in the bus, sided with the bus driver against us. We thought the matter will be settled at the police station but what happened there was totally different from what we expected,"" he said.
After the groom's parents, who were waiting for them, were informed the incident, the engagement party, as a group went to Pangode Police Station, where they encountered an indifferent attitude from the police. ""All members of our family, including my father and other elders, some of whom were who were even cardiac patients, were made to sit in the lock-up,"" Harshitha said.

Trivandrum: The Congress-led opposition staged a walkout in the Kerala assembly on Wednesday over increasing crimes.They also accused chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who also handles the home portfolio, of not being present to take their questions.They cited several instances of gang attacks and police atrocities on citizens this week.They included a sub-inspector detaining an expatriate on the way to his daughter’s betrothal and a singer getting killed by armed men in a predawn attack.Congress leader K Muraleedharan, who wanted to adjourn regular business to discuss the issue, urged Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan to ensure Vijayan’s presence.“Today is the third day he is absent. We feel he gives scant respect to the legislature as he is more keen on attending party meetings,” he said.“He has no time to devote to administrative matters and files are piling up his office while the criminals are on the prowl.” The Communist Party of India (Marxist) strongman was attending a series of party meetings, even that of its trade union wing, during the past three months.He is currently in New Delhi attending its three-day central committee meeting that began on Wednesday.“His party has no significant presence anywhere in India except Kerala, and he’s its lone chief minister,” he later said. “They could have held it here and let there be some order.” On Tuesday, four armed hacked a young singer, ‘Rasikan’ Rajesh, to death at his studios in the state capital but there were no arrests so far, he said citing newspapers.The 35-year-old who had worked in Doha as a radio jockey at a Malayalam FM station was conducting stage shows after his return recently.Replying on his behalf, works minister G Sudhakaran said it was not fair to target the chief minister as he has to attend his party meetings unlike other “undisciplined parties”.“Raising his absence here is unfair as he had informed the opposition the need for him to be in Delhi to attend a party meeting,” he said.“It has now become a habit with you (opposition) to come with leave for an adjournment motion and then link it to the chief minister and attack him.” Add this page to your favorite Social Bookmarking websites",english

Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) managing director V J Kurien announced on Wednesday that they would be launching waterway connectivity between the international airport in Nedumbassery and Marine Drive.
""It will be realised under the Kerala Waterways and Infrastructures Ltd ( KWIL ) project which envisages waterway connectivity from Kasaragod to Kovalam. This waterway project will be completed in May, 2020. The Cial-Marine Drive stretch will have a length of around 30 to 32 km and could be completed ahead of it,"" said V J Kurien, who did not disclose the estimated time to complete the stretch.
He said that they would be operating a solar boat. Cial officials said they are currently in talks with solar boat companies for this purpose. The exact route of the waterway is yet to be finalized.
""This will be a pilot project aiming to get aspects of the KWIL inland waterway project up and running before the launch. The main aim of this project is to show that we can operate a boat along this path, offering connectivity while at the same time it would not create pollution, affect the water life or create problems for farmers,"" said a Cial official.
He said that the inland waterway project would be running through Chengalthodu canal which is an 'overflow basin' of Periyar river. ""The pathway already exists. We would only have dredge it to make it bigger,"" he added.
K Shivaprasad, associate professor, department of shipping technology, Cusat, said connecting Nedumbassery and Marine Drive is an ambitious undertaking. ""It isn't easy to dredge a canal and make it part of a waterway. They would also have to secure several environment clearances before they could proceed with it,"" he said.
Cial, which holds 49% share in the KWIL project, expects to establish similar connectivity between airports and cities in Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur.
""We will be setting up a similar airport and city connectivity in Thiruvananthapuram, connecting the airport with Parvathy Puthanar canal via Chakka. And in Kannur, the airport will be connected via Anjarakandy river,"" said Cial official.
KWIL aims to establish an inland waterway with a length of 450km linking 11 districts from Kasaragod to Kovalam. The project announced in the summer of 2017, is being implemented under the direct monitoring of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.",english

CNN-News18’s Marya Shakil talks to the man tasked with that objective, Ram Madhav , who talks about the accusations that the Centre was financially discriminating against southern states in favour of the northern ones, the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh, the Lingayat question in Karnataka and much more. 
You had a meeting with Financial Commission chairman NK Singh. Is BJP worried that an anti-south party tag is hurting it? 
My meeting with chairman of 15th financial commission was about new terms of reference, handed down to commission by President of India. We had talked about the issue that 2011 census is going to be basis for population growth, we had reservations about that, because we thought it will do injustice to progressive states. Progressive states, not just in south India, in other parts as well. Don’t want to take their names for political reasons, but I know for sure that taking the 2011 census as basis for 15th Finance Commission will cause some difficulty to some states that have focused so much in the sphere of population regulation in the last 30 years. Earlier the 1971 census was used so we basically wanted to know is now what is the reality from him (NK Singh). What we are reading in papers is true or not. He reassured us that planning commission wouldn’t do any injustice to our state and progressive states will get their share. 
How are you looking at statement of Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, who has accused the Centre of discriminating against states ? This is all politics over whatever is available to them. The 15th Finance Commission will start its work later this year, maybe next month. It will not submit work to this government but next one which will come to power in 2019. This mean Siddaramaiah thinks that in 2019 also, there will be a BJP government, which it will be. But our larger issue is that all states should get justice. 
What about this argument that balance of fiscal power is shifting to northern states that are less productive, while southern states contribute much more? 
This is all fear politicking… trying to divide country. Right now you’re going geographically where you are trying to create artificial divide between south & north when it doesn’t exist. As I said, progressive states are there in all parts of country, I’m not demeaning other states. They have all achieved certain benchmarks. People like Siddaramaiah, for their sheer political ends, are trying to create artificial divide between north & south. It doesn’t exist. 
CM of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, has supported Siddaramaiah. He has asked all CMs of 5 south states to come together and unite. 
Birds of same feather, they will do this. These parties trying to create a rift between states and states, which is not good for us. 
Has the BJP been caught off guard on question of minority status to Lingayats? Now that seer of influential muth has said that he is supporting Siddaramaiah rather than supporting BJP president Amit Shah who has been in Karnataka trying to unite various muths. 
Our party president has made it clear that his visit was to seek blessings of Lingayat leadership, it wasn’t political visit. Whether to use such issues for political ends. Now whether or not to use such issues for political ends is for parties to use their wisdom. Although state government enjoys certain powers, for a particular community to be declared minority, should it be used as a political weapon, is something that the parties have to choose, I don’t want to say anything beyond that. 
The BJP is projecting Congress as anti-Hindu party calling the Lingayat religious campaign as a divisive one. Do you think it will earn dividends post May 15th? 
Congress party is trying to project this. They first said they are being accused of being anti-Hindu, we did not. Now they are trying very hard to prove the point. This temple hopping that’s going on is their own over-zealousness to prove themselves as pro-Hindu. As far as we are concerned, Congress has history of communalising politics, of playing appeasement politics, polarised politics, this is what we have always highlighted and will continue to highlight this character of the Congress party. 
But seers of these Maths are saying that such a move by Siddaramaiah would act as a unifier of Lingayats… 
A critical question to be looked at is something that is purely religious, if what Lingayat leaders are saying is true, should we really use it as a political weapon in elections? That’s an important question. 
But hasn’t BJP done that in the past? 
No, never for electoral purposes. We never tried to divide Hindus. Rather, we tried to create oneness, so our doing such things question doesn’t arise. We have always held that we don’t believe in appeasement politics, I’m only talking of politicising issue. If a community wants certain favours, certain status, such things have happened in the past also. Even respected organisations like Ramakrishna Mission wanted minority status in West Bengal. Those things have happened in past also, but you can’t blame BJP for playing appeasement politics. 
It is being said that Siddaramaiah playing by BJP’s electoral playbook, he’s pre-empting every electoral move of BJP, be it on question of Kannada pride, sub-nationalist identity, on the question of Hindi language… 
Siddaramaiah trying to play utterly divisive politics. By invoking north-south divide, by invoking anti-BJP sentiments, he is trying to use issues as emotive issues to garner votes. He is seeing defeat staring him in their face, which is why he’s resorting to these techniques. 
What about Rahul Gandhi’s charge that JD (S) is the B-team of BJP? 
People will laugh at it. They have seen (Congress) government with JD (S) in Karnataka, they cannot blame BJP for using JD (S) as b-team. As far as we are concerned, we are confident that we will get required numbers in Karnataka. 
Now that the question of minority status to Lingayats is pending with Centre, because notification has to be moved and approved by it. What is the government’s stand? 
I don’t know, this decision taken by the cabinet and government, let’s wait. 
In Karnataka, Telugu people have started a campaign, they are saying BJP has betrayed people of Andhra Pradesh, they have betrayed on Andhra Pradesh reorganisation. Given that they are a substantial number in close to 20 constituencies, do you think it’ll hurt BJP? 
Let’s not come to conclusion that everyone in Andhra Pradesh is TDP supporter. It’s not that way, and this entire propaganda of the TDP that BJP is hurting interests of Andhra people is not bought by people of Andhra Pradesh either. People of Andhra Pradesh are getting up and questioning TDP corruption and many more things. So, to conclude (that) all of Andhra Pradesh (is) behind Telugu Desam, and then to conclude that everyone outside Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (is) supporting them is an exaggeration. We have strong leadership in Telugu speaking areas of Karnataka also, remember they are all voters of Karnataka state. For them, Karnataka’s interest (is) paramount and they believe in BJP as the real party to secure interests of (the) state. 
Is BJP worried? 
Not at all, every election a challenge, we take every election very seriously. The issues, if they impact any section of voters like you are saying that sentiment in Andhra Pradesh will impact, then we take note of it and address it. 
The Centre says they have fulfilled their promises. Why is it that neither the YSR Congress nor the TDP believes you? 
These two parties are politicising the whole issue, the debate should have been centred on developmental issues. They have moved away from development to utter, sheer politics now, it’s the politicization of a development discourse. For us, the state of Andhra Pradesh, a new state, it needed a lot of support from the centre. The Government of India has extended a lot of support in the last four years. Our party president has sent a detailed note in the form of a letter to the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. We have given so much, Naidu can say anything but facts cannot be denied. The letter is full of facts and figures and that cannot be denied. On the contrary, the propaganda the TDP is unleashing is full of lies. 
Of the 19 demands in the AP Reorganization act, one example is that of the railway zone in Vizag which has been denied by the Centre… 
When did we deny it? You show me one statement when we have denied it. These 19 demands were to be fulfilled in 10 years, there is a timespan for that. We have not denied the railway zone, we have not denied anything except the tag of special category state or ‘special status’ after the promulgation of 14th Finance Commission. The implementation of those recommendations, it has become untenable for us to extend this tag to any state except the north-eastern states. That is the only thing we said we cannot probably do and mind you, that is not part of the document of the new state creation. 
All other things, we are committed to fulfilling them. There are so many things that were supposed to (be) completed in 10 years, we have completed in 3 years. Those which have not been completed in 4 years, they are taking that up and they are not talking about that also, they are just talking about the tag of the special category. 
Our point is, as far as those 19 issues are concerned, it is a development debate. You can argue with us, you can fight with us. But they are only fighting on an emotive issue which is special category status that means that they are misleading people of Andhra Pradesh. It’s not the status, it’s development which is needed. It’s not sentiment that is needed. 
We are committed to the development of Andhra Pradesh as much as Naidu or Jaganmohan Reddy put together. 
Coming to the special package, TDP is saying that you will give something that will (be) equivalent to a special status, but no guidelines have been fixed till now 
Not true. So many rounds of discussions have happened. Since I was not part of those discussions, I am not privy to what went on. But our leaders have told us that in all these meeting(s) there were so many occasions where the AP government has agreed to take a certain package from the state and then backed off, as late as of February this year. They were supposed to come up with a new financial vehicle to take money from the centre, we are ready with Rs 9,300 crores of development money and they had agreed to take it. The only question was under which instrument they will take it, finally, they backed out. 
On Rs 2500 crores for development of Amravati, the Naidu government is saying that they have submitted utilisation certificates, Rs 1500 crore was for the development of capital, and Rs 1000 crores was used for the building of secretariat and roads leading to it… 
Fair enough, they will get all the additional money from the centre. The money that was given, that was spent, they will even get more money, they have got much more money. They are only talking about Rs 2500 crores, they have gotten many more things in those 4 years under the 14th Finance Commission. They got 42 percent of the share, from 32 to 43 percent they got a huge rise in their share of central revenues. 
There is a specific charge against you, that you are trying to weaken regional parties. The reason why Naidu is making this move is because you are pitting him against YSR Congress and also encouraging Pawan Kalyan in this process… 
First of all TDP and YSR Congress are 2 big parties, they are opposition to each other. We don’t have to pit them against each other, they are already against each other. They fought against each other in the last elections. They are two big parties, who are we to pit them against each other? So this whole ‘rona dhona’ is uncalled for. 
Is the BJP in touch with Jaganmohan Reddy? 
Absolutely not. These are the lies that TDP is propagating, that is the whole crux of the issue. They face a real challenge from the regional party, so in order to get out of that they are inventing issues and using lies to blame the Centre. 
But are you not worried that perhaps K Chandrashekar Rao and Naidu could come together and this entire perception of BJP being anti-south could gain momentum because Naidu has also said that you are collecting funds from southern states and moving it towards the north? 
A. Shows the level of maturity of the leaders who are making those arguments. If we go that by argument than many more such arguments will follow, someone in Rayalaseema stood up and said that in Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema is being subjected to great injustice, and Naidu was very unhappy that someone is raising the issue of Rayalaseema now. If you start dividing the country, there is no end to it. We are committed to extending our full support to Andhra Pradesh. As far as politics is concerned, Naidu was with us till one month ago, he left us before also. Now he wants to have another tent, let him go to that front. He is free, this is a democracy. 
is there any possibility of Naidu returning? 
I don’t know. You should ask him, not me. 
There are talks of a federal front again, as we see before every election… 
As I said before, first of all, Mamata Banerjee was here. She was talking about the third front, we want to know what is the second front in this country. If there is already a third front, already there is a fourth front. Lunch diplomacy in Calcutta, dinner diplomacy in Delhi. We are not worried. 
That means for 2019, it is BJP vs all, Modi vs all? 
That’s a very good point you’re making. It shows that the opposition, no single party today is confident enough to take on BJP, that much is clear. So holy, unholy alliances, efforts will go on. Let them try because we are here to tackle any sort of challenge. In 2019, we are going to go back to the people with Modiji as our leader and five years of our governance and its achievements. With that we’re going to the people. 
But one partnership has actually worked in UP, BSP and SP coming together. Are you not worried? 
No, not at all. So many elections have happened in this very year, we have won handsomely in a number of states, end of last year we won in Himachal, Gujarat. This year, we had three governments, we have dethroned Congress in one state. One or two by-elections, they are a wakeup call for us, we will definitely try and understand what went wrong but to say that there is demoralization. etc., it is farfetched. 
In the North East, do you see the BJP’s growth there as an organic growth? The view is this that the north-eastern states invariably ally with the Centre… 
Then tell me why there was a Communist government when there was a Congress government in the Centre? Take the case of Tripura, why there was an NPF government in Nagaland when there was a Congress government in Delhi. These are arguments of losers, they want to hide their defeat in the last elections, hide their failures. They say that just because BJP is in power in Delhi, they are allying with them. BJP has done a lot of hard work on the ground, its base has expanded in the north-east. I attribute special importance to two victories, one is in Tripura and the other in Nagaland. A state of more than 95 percent Christian population today has the deputy CM from BJP, 12 MLAs in the 60 member legislature are from BJP with 16 percent vote share. Similarly is Tripura, which came from Communist parties’ stranglehold to the BJP with two third majority. 
In Nagaland and Meghalaya, there have been protests in the assemblies against Hindi. Are you not somewhere moving away from the cultural diversity that India stands for? 
First of all, there is no Hindi push. People are free to use their mother tongue, whatever language they are used to, they are free to use that. There is no push from our side. But remember Hindi is one of the important national languages of this country, our official language. So, if a particular person uses Hindi, it shouldn’t be seen as somebody is imposing it on them. Where is the question of any imposition? 
Regarding Jammu and Kashmir, since you are in charge of the state as well, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Hansraj Ahir, said in the Lok Sabha that the government of India has no proposal of scrapping Article 370. Isn’t this completely different from the stand of the BJP? 
Parliament questions are specific to that time. There was a question whether there was any move to scrap Article 370 before the government today, he said no, there is no such move. That does not represent any ideological position, just the position and the activity of the government on the given day. That is the reply he had to give. As far as the ideological position is concerned, in our agenda of alliance in Kashmir, we said PDP and BJP have two different positions on Article 370. These are ideological positions, but for them to materialise there needs to be a conducive atmosphere in the parliament. It is utterly wrong to interpret that our ideological position has diluted or we have shifted from that position. But as a government, what is the present status that we have to tell the country through the parliament. 
Let me (be) specific this time and go back to the question that I asked before, is BJP an anti-south party?

TNN | Updated: Mar 29, 2018, 08:30 IST Representative Image THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The victim of yet another incident of alleged police excess, a young doctor whose engagement had to be cancelled, petitioned chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , national human rights commission and state police chief Loknath Behera seeking action against the sub-inspector and policemen of Pangode police station in the capital. Kazhakkoottam native Harshitha said in her petition that her parents and other close relatives, who were on their way for her engagement, were harassed by the police and a false case was charged against her father. ""I have sought action against the sub-inspector and other policemen. The policemen who were supposed to protect the general public, have caused us immense mental trauma. They harassed us,"" Harshitha said. Her father, Hakim Badaruddin said the police version to register a case against him was completely cooked up, and that he will fight for justice. ""A KSRTC bus collided with our vehicle causing damaging the mirror. A policeman, who was a member of the special branch, travelling in the bus, sided with the bus driver against us. We thought the matter will be settled at the police station but what happened there was totally different from what we expected,"" he said. After the groom's parents, who were waiting for them, were informed the incident, the engagement party, as a group went to Pangode Police Station, where they encountered an indifferent attitude from the police. ""All members of our family, including my father and other elders, some of whom were who were even cardiac patients, were made to sit in the lock-up,"" Harshitha said. She alleged that the police deliberately delayed producing her father, against whom several unnecessary charges were framed in the FIR, in court denying him bail. ""He was remanded on Saturday, and finally got bail on Tuesday. Had he been produced in the court in Saturday itself, he would have been granted bail,"" she said. Meanwhile, Loknath Behera said that he has not yet received the petition. ""I am yet to see such a petition. We will definitely inquire into it and take necessary action,"" he said.  ",english

PWD minister G Sudhakaran, who spoke on behalf of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the assembly on Wednesday, said all efforts were on to nab the assailants at the earliest. 

However, he refuted the opposition's claim that the government has failed to act tough against notorious goonda quotation gangs in the state. 

""The murder of Rajesh was unexpected and horrific. It's also an isolated incident. But the opposition should not try to create a fear psychosis by demanding detailed discussion on such an isolated incident,"" he said. 

MLA K Muraleedharan, who gave notice for adjournment motion on government's alleged failure to rein in the activities of goonda quotation gangs, said police were not only a failure to eliminate such notorious gangs, but they themselves indulge in criminal activities against citizens. He said the LDF government had put an end to the 'operation kubera' campaign against loan sharks. ""Who are these criminal gangs? The government has been trying to dismiss the quotation killings as isolated incidents, but murders continue. Police have failed to silence these gangs. In some cases, police have turned out to be the culprits. Police act as both executioner and saviour. Owing to insensitive handling of a petty incident by Pangode police, the engagement of the daughter of a gulf expatriate had to be called off,'' he said. 

However, the works minister said the overall quality of policing has improved manifold after the LDF government came to power. Till December 31, 2017, as many as 427 Kaapa cases were registered against 167 persons. Of this, 81 were jailed. Till March 28, 2018, after the LDF came to power, police conducted 14,812 raids against usurers and 3,378 cases were registered. As many as 2,198 people were arrested in this connection, he said. 

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said most of the laurels that Kerala police received during the LDF term were the result of the initiatives started by the UDF government. ""Neither the CM, nor the DGP has control over police personnel. How the police handle the criminal gangs is important. CM had earlier claimed that government would publish a list of history-sheeters. But that did not happen till date. Chief minister, like Narendra Modi, has a penchant for skipping the proceedings of the house,"" he said. Protesting over speaker's denial of permission to the no confidence motion, opposition staged a walk out from the House.",english

Last year it was widely reported in India that that a Hindu “holy man” in Kerala lost 90 percent of his penis when he was ‘ bobbitised ‘ by a young woman he had allegedly been raping over several years. 
A series of bizarre twists and turns took place after the attack on Hari Sami aka Swami Gangeshananda aka Sree Hari: he was arrested in connection with the alleged rapes, then released after the alleged victim, a law student, said he was a “good man” who never raped her. 
Then the swami claimed that the knife wound was self-inflicted. 
“Aparna” – not her real name – gave police a confusing account of how the self-styled “godman” came to lose his dick, claiming that two others had incited her to carry out the attack because the swami had been fleecing her family, as well as theirs. 
Well, the story resurfaced this week when the “godman” told media that he and his penis had been reunited though surgery. 
After changing his statement twice Hari Swami now claims that some “bigwigs are working against him” and they were the ones were behind his penis chopping. 
While I claimed then that I myself did it so as to get away from further trouble, the truth is that the same people whom I helped were behind this act and more than one person did it. 
The 55-year-old said he had been in a lot of pain and had even considered getting his penis removed completely. 
The “godman” had been rushed to hospital for a plastic surgery to get his penis re-attached. However, due to the severity of the wound, surgery could not be performed immediately, and it was only this week that surgeons managed to restore his penis. 
Following the incident, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had praised the woman calling it: 
A courageous and strong act by the woman.

In accordance with the new railway policy of the Union metro, the necessary amendments were introduced in the previous DPR.
The Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has informed the Assembly that the previous DPR presented for approval before the Center in 2015, is being revised based on the new railway policy of the metro in 2017. “Once the necessary verifications are completed, the project report will be presented before the Government of the Union for approval, “Pinarayi said in a written response to the questions of K Muraleedharan, KS Sabarinathan, VS Sivakumar and M Vincent.
According to the new policy, it is the respective state governments that must send the approval request. Kerala Rapid Transit Corporation Ltd (KRTL), the special purpose vehicle formed by the state government for the implementation of the Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode Light Metro projects, has been entrusted with the task of collecting the necessary details. On behalf of KRTL, DMRC has reviewed the DPR. Responding to another question, the Chief Minister said that central assent is not necessary for rail subway projects fully implemented by state governments. Although it is technically feasible, it will not be viable considering an additional financial burden for the state government.
According to the new policy of the Government of the Union, a particular city is identified for the metro project after exploring other feasible and less expensive public transport facilities available there. Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode have been identified for the light rail project after going through such detailed verification, said the CM.
Total cost of the project Rs 7,446 crore 
According to the revised DPR, the total cost of the project for the two light rail projects will be approximately R $ 7,446 crore. Excluding funds needed for land acquisition, state taxes and money for works related to PPP, Rs 6,307 crore will be needed. Of this 20 percent, each will be assumed by the state and central governments. The remaining 60 percent will be through a loan. Rs 392 crore required for land acquisition and state taxes in the amount of Rs. 534 crore will be satisfied by the state. In total, the state will have to be grouped in Rs 2.187 crore.",english

സംസ്ഥാനം മറ്റൊരു സാമ്പത്തിക തിരിച്ചടിയുടെ കൂടി നിഴലിലാണ്. ജിഎസ്ടിയും കേന്ദ്രനയങ്ങളും സംസ്ഥാനത്തെ സാമ്പത്തികമായി ഞെരുക്കുന്നതിനിടയിൽ അടുത്ത ധനകമീഷൻ ശുപാർശയും സംസ്ഥാനത്തിന് വൻ നഷ്ടം വരുത്തുമെന്നാണ് സൂചന. ഇക്കുറി കേരളം ഒറ്റയ്ക്കല്ല. താരതമ്യേന മെച്ചപ്പെട്ട സാമൂഹ്യവികസന സൂചകങ്ങളും കുടുംബാസൂത്രണമേഖലയിൽ മികവുമുള്ള മറ്റ് ദക്ഷിണേന്ത്യൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളും ഈ പ്രതിസന്ധി അഭിമുഖീകരിക്കുകയാണ്. 2011ലെ ജനസംഖ്യ ആധാരമാക്കി ശുപാർശകൾ തയ്യാറാക്കാനുള്ള പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷൻ തീരുമാനമാണ് കേരളത്തിനും മറ്റ് ദക്ഷിണേന്ത്യൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്കും വൻ നഷ്ടം വരുത്തുക. കേന്ദ്രവും സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുമായി രാജ്യത്തിന്റെ വരുമാനം വീതംവയ്ക്കുകയാണ് ധനകമീഷന്റെ ഉത്തരവാദിത്തം. 2020 മുതൽ 2025 വരെ അഞ്ചുവർഷം രാജ്യത്ത് നടപ്പാക്കാനുള്ള സാമ്പത്തിക നിർദേശങ്ങളാണ് പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷൻ സമർപ്പിക്കേണ്ടത്. ഇതിന് സ്വീകരിക്കുന്ന മാനദണ്ഡങ്ങൾ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്കുകൂടി സ്വീകാര്യമാകണം എന്നത് ജനാധിപത്യ മര്യാദ. എന്നാൽ, എല്ലാ രംഗത്തും ജനാധിപത്യവിരുദ്ധത മുഖമുദ്രയാക്കിയ ബിജെപി സർക്കാരിനു കീഴിൽ രൂപംകൊണ്ട പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷൻ തീർത്തും ഏകപക്ഷീയ നടപടികളുമായി മുന്നോട്ടു നീങ്ങുകയാണ്. 
കുടുംബാസൂത്രണപരിപാടികൾ വ്യാപകമായി രാജ്യത്ത് നടപ്പാക്കുന്നതിനുമുമ്പുള്ള ജനസംഖ്യാകണക്കെടുപ്പാണ് 1971ലേത്. പതിമൂന്നാം ധനകമീഷൻവരെ 1971ലെ സെൻസസ് കണക്കുകൾ അനുസരിച്ചായിരുന്നു സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്കുള്ള വിഹിതം നിർണയിച്ചിരുന്നത്. പതിനാലാം ധനകമീഷൻ 2011ലെ സെൻസസ് ആധാരമാക്കാനുള്ള ശ്രമം നടത്തിയിരുന്നെങ്കിലും ശക്തമായ പ്രതിഷേധം ഉയർന്നതോടെ ഈ നീക്കം ഭാഗികമായി ഉപേക്ഷിച്ചു. 2011ലെ സെൻസസിന് 10 ശതമാനം അധിക പരിഗണനമാത്രം നൽകിക്കൊണ്ടായിരുന്നു പതിനാലാം ധനകമീഷൻ നിർദേശങ്ങൾ സമർപ്പിച്ചത്. അപ്പോൾത്തന്നെ, തമിഴ്നാടുപോലുള്ള സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്ക് ഇത് വലിയ നഷ്ടമുണ്ടാക്കി. പതിമൂന്നാം ധനകമീഷനെ അപേക്ഷിച്ച് തമിഴ്നാടിന്റെ റവന്യൂ വിഹിതം 19 ശതമാനം വെട്ടിക്കുറച്ചുകൊണ്ടായിരുന്നു പതിനാലാം ധനകമീഷൻ നിർദേശങ്ങൾ. 6000 കോടി രൂപയുടെ കുറവ് ഇങ്ങനെ വന്നു. കേന്ദ്ര നികുതിവിഹിതത്തിൽത്തന്നെ കടുത്ത അനീതി നിലനിൽക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. നിലവിൽ നികുതിയിലൂടെയും മറ്റും കേരളം കേന്ദ്രത്തിന് കൊടുക്കുന്ന ഓരോ രൂപയ്ക്കും കേവലം 25 പൈസയാണ് നികുതിവിഹിതമെന്ന നിലയ്ക്ക് തിരികെ ലഭിക്കുന്നത്. തമിഴ്നാടിന്റെ സമാനമായ വിഹിതം 40 പൈസയും കർണാടകത്തിന്റേത് 47 പൈസയുമാണ്. അതേസമയം, ഉത്തർപ്രദേശിന് ഒരു രൂപയ്ക്ക് തിരികെ ലഭിക്കുന്നത് ഒരു രൂപ 79 പൈസയാണ്. പുതിയ നിർദേശം നടപ്പാക്കപ്പെടുകയാണെങ്കിൽ വിഹിതവിതരണത്തിലെ ഈ അസന്തുലിതാവസ്ഥ കൂടുതൽ രൂക്ഷമാകുമെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ അടക്കമുള്ളവർ ചൂണ്ടിക്കാട്ടുന്നു. 
മറ്റ് തരത്തിലും സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്ക് വിനയാകുന്ന നിർദേശങ്ങൾ തയ്യാറാക്കാനും ധനകമീഷനെ സർക്കാർ ചുമതലപ്പെടുത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ റവന്യൂവരുമാനവും ചെലവും തമ്മിലുള്ള അന്തരം പരിഹരിക്കുന്നതിന് കേന്ദ്ര സർക്കാർ നൽകുന്ന പ്രത്യേക സഹായം (റവന്യൂ ഡെഫിസിറ്റ് ഗ്രാന്റ്) സംബന്ധിച്ച പുനഃപരിശോധനയാണ് ഇത്തരത്തിൽ കമീഷന് നൽകിയ മറ്റൊരു പ്രധാന ചുമതല. ഗ്രാന്റ് അവസാനിപ്പിക്കാനുള്ള നീക്കത്തിന്റെ ഭാഗമാണ് ഇതെന്ന് സംശയിക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. ഇതും കേരളത്തിന് തിരിച്ചടിയാകും. 2015‐16ൽ ഈ ഇനത്തിൽ 4300 കോടി രൂപ കേന്ദ്രത്തിൽനിന്ന് കേരളത്തിന് ലഭിച്ചിരുന്നു. സാമൂഹ്യസുരക്ഷാ മേഖലയിലടക്കമുള്ള ഇടപെടലുകൾമൂലം വൻതോതിൽ റവന്യൂ വിടവ് നേരിടുന്ന സംസ്ഥാനമാണ് കേരളം. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ കടമെടുക്കാനുള്ള സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യം കവരാനുള്ള നീക്കമുള്ളതായും സംശയം ഉയരുന്നുണ്ട്. കേന്ദ്രത്തിൽനിന്ന് എടുക്കുന്ന കടം പൂർണമായും അടച്ചുതീർത്താൽ, പിന്നീട് പൊതുവിപണിയിൽനിന്ന് കടമെടുക്കുന്നതിന് സംസ്ഥാനം മുൻകൂർ അനുവാദം തേടേണ്ടതില്ലെന്നാണ് നിലവിലെ വ്യവസ്ഥ. ഈ ഭരണഘടനാ സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യം ഇല്ലാതാക്കാൻ ന്യൂ ഇന്ത്യ‐2022 എന്ന പേരിൽ പദ്ധതി കൊണ്ടുവന്ന് അതിന് ഭരണഘടനാ സാധുത നൽകാനുള്ള ആലോചനയും പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷന്റെ പരിഗണനാവിഷയത്തിലുണ്ട്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളെ ശിക്ഷിക്കുന്ന ഈ നടപടികൾ ഗുരുതര പ്രത്യാഘാതങ്ങൾക്ക് വഴിവയ്ക്കുമെന്നാണ് വിദഗ്ധർ വിലയിരുത്തുന്നത്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്ക് സ്വന്തമായി നികുതിവരുമാനം കണ്ടെത്താനുള്ള സാധ്യത ജിഎസ്ടിയിലൂടെ ഇല്ലാതാക്കിയതിനു പുറമെയാണ് പുതിയ നീക്കമെന്നത് കൂടുതൽ ആപൽക്കരമാകുന്നു. 

ബിജെപി സർക്കാർ വന്നശേഷം നിയമിക്കപ്പെട്ട പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷന്റെ ഈ നീക്കത്തിനു പിന്നിൽ രാഷ്ട്രീയലക്ഷ്യങ്ങളും സംശയിക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. സാമൂഹ്യവളർച്ചയിൽ മുന്നിലും ബിജെപിയുടെ സ്വാധീനത്തിൽ പിന്നിലും നിൽക്കുന്ന തെക്കൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളെ തകർക്കുന്ന നടപടിയാണ് ഇതെന്ന് ചൂണ്ടിക്കാണിക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. തെക്കും വടക്കും ഇന്ത്യകൾ തമ്മിൽ വലിയ ഭിന്നതയ്ക്കും ഇത് ഇടവരുത്താം. ബ്രിട്ടനും സ്കോട്ലൻഡും തമ്മിലും സ്പെയിനും കത്തലൂണിയയും തമ്മിലും രൂപപ്പെട്ട വിഘടനവാദത്തോളമെത്തിയ പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾപോലെ ധനകമീഷന്റെ നടപടി ഇന്ത്യയെയും അപകടത്തിലാക്കിയേക്കാം എന്നുപോലും വിദഗ്ധർ പറയുന്നു. 
ഏതായാലും കേരളം വെറുതെയിരിക്കുകയല്ല. എപ്പോഴും ജനാധിപത്യവിരുദ്ധ നീക്കങ്ങൾക്കെതിരെ ശക്തമായി പ്രതികരിക്കാറുള്ള സംസ്ഥാനം ഇക്കുറി സർക്കാർ മുൻകൈയോടെതന്നെ ധനകമീഷൻ നീക്കത്തിനെതിരെ പോർമുഖം തുറക്കുകയാണ്. പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷന്റെ സംസ്ഥാനവിരുദ്ധ നീക്കങ്ങളെ ചെറുക്കുന്നതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ആലോചിക്കാൻ ദക്ഷിണേന്ത്യൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ കൂട്ടായ്മ ഏപ്രിൽ 10ന് തിരുവനന്തപുരത്ത് വിളിച്ചുചേർത്തിരിക്കുകയാണ്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ അധികാരങ്ങളും വിഭവങ്ങളും കവരാനുള്ള കേന്ദ്രനീക്കത്തിനെതിരെ രാജ്യമാകെ അണിചേർന്ന് നടത്തേണ്ട പോരാട്ടത്തിന് ഇവിടെനിന്ന് തുടക്കമാകുമെന്ന് പ്രത്യാശിക്കാം.",malayalam

Railways and Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) will jointly carry out a feasibility study for third and fourth lines in the 574-km rail corridor from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod. 
An agreement to this effect was reached in talks Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had with Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani in New Delhi on Thursday. 
A preliminary feasibility study carried out by the KRDCL, a joint venture between the State and Railways for executing viable projects on 51:49 cost-sharing basis, had found that the project will cost ₹46,769 crore. 
Railways are of the view that the proposed coach factory at Kanjikode in Palakkad is not feasible as three factories are currently manufacturing conventional rakes. The Chairman informed the Chief Minister that Railways will look into the possibility of manufacturing metro coaches there.

ISRO has lined up a host of ""very high profile missions,"" including Chandrayaan-2 and demonstration of human space programme this year, the space agency's chairman K Sivan said today. 

""Lot of work is in front of you (scientists). Definitely you will be doing it. I do not have any doubt on that... the missions we are planning this year, all 10 missions are very high profile missions,"" Mr Sivan said. 

Mr Sivan was addressing the scientists at the Mission Control Centre after the successful launch of the communication satellite GSAT-6A onboard Geosynchronous rocket GSLV-F08 from the spaceport. 

Listing the missions, he said ""Chandrayaan-2 is going to land on Moon and rover will be roving on the Moon."" 

""Then we are going to have (launch of) high power, high bandwidth communication satellite to provide high bandwidth connectivity to remote places of India. 

""We are going to have one demonstration of human space programme technology development also (this year),"" he said. 

ISRO had said recently that the launch of India's second lunar mission Chandrayaan-2, slated for next month, has been put off to October as some tests have been suggested by experts. 

Mr Sivan said ISRO would also launch a couple of remote sensing satellites including IRNSS-1I over the next few weeks. 

GSLV-FO8 Mission Director Mohan said today's successful launch was a very significant milestone in GSLV programme as the new technologies would lead to enhancement of payload to more than 2.5 tonnes in near future. 

""The thrust uprightment of the second stage and full utilisation of cryostage propellant are two significant technologies demonstrated today,"" he said. Supreme Court Collegium Breaks Traditions, Interacts With To-Be High Court Judges In an apparent effort to ward off criticism of opaqueness, the Supreme Court collegium has broken the tradition by interacting with as many as 12 lawyers and trial court judges who were recommended for appointment as permanent judges in the Calcutta and Madhya Pradesh High Courts. 

The top court collegium, comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and two senior-most judges justices J Chelameswar and Ranjan Gogoi, created a history of sorts by conducting an informal interview of the persons who were shortlisted by the respective High Court collegiums. 

The Supreme Court collegium considered various materials, including the views of the state Chief Ministers as forwarded by their respective Governors and the Intelligence Bureau reports. 

""Apart from this, we invited all the recommendees with a view to have an interaction with them,"" the collegium noted in its decision. 

For the Calcutta High Court, the collegium has recommended the names of five advocates -- Biswajit Basu, Amrita Sinha, Dr Sutanu Kumar Patra, Abhijit Gangopadhyay and Jay Sengupta. 

It has recommended the names of advocate Sanjay Dwivedi, and four judicial officers -- Akhil Kumar Shrivastava, Brij Kishore Shrivastava, Rajendra Kumar Shrivastava and Mohd Fahim Anwar, for appointment as permanent judges in the Madhya Pradesh High Court. From 2022, High-Speed Bullet Train From Mumbai To Ahmedabad Every 20 Mins The dream of India's first high-speed bullet train which would run between Ahmedabad and Mumbai is close to becoming a reality. The operations for this ambitious project will commence as soon as 2022, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has said. The train will have 10 coaches, a seating capacity of 750 passengers and will leave Mumbai for Ahmedabad every 20 minutes.  

The announcement was made by the railway minister on Twitter today. 

India Gears Up For Bullet Train: The Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed bullet train to commence operations from 2022. The train will leave every 20 minutes from Mumbai to Ahmedabad and have 10 coaches with the seating capacity of 750 passengers. pic.twitter.com/OMDko6xwuI 

— Piyush Goyal Office (@PiyushGoyalOffc) March 27, 2018 

The high-speed bullet train aims to reduce the travel time from Mumbai to Ahmedabad to just three hours. It currently takes seven hours to cover the 500 kilometre journey by train.  

The bullet train will halt at 12 stations.  

The land for the project, which was launched last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, has already been bought and the process of designing of bridges and tunnels has been initiated.  

Though many are excited about the launch of this high-speed train, it has gathered a lot of criticism too, especially from opposition parties.  

The biggest attack, though, from came from BJP ally Shiv Sena, following the stampede on the foot over-bridge linking Elphinstone Road and Parel suburban stations in Mumbai in September last year.  

""How come the central government didn't have money to spend on a bridge used by poor commuters but gave Rs. 30,000 crores in one day"" for the bullet trains,"" the Sena had said.  

As a comeback to those opposing the project, Prime Minister Modi had said ""those opposing the bullet train project should travel on bullock carts."" 1.3 Lakh A Day? Devendra Fadnavis Must Explain ""Chai Pe Kharcha"": Congress 
The Congress has alleged a 'chai scam' in Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's office after an RTI reply showed a surge in the money spent on serving tea. The RTI or Right To Information petition was filed by youth congress leader Nikhil Kamble.  

""The Chief Minister is only doing chai pe charcha (a term coined by the BJP for its hugely successful voter outreach in 2014 inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tea-selling past) but no real work,"" said Mumbai Congress Chief Sanjay Nirupam. 

According to an RTI query, the amount spent on tea in the office of Devendra Fadnavis in 2016-17 was Rs. 1,20,92,972. That amount jumped to Rs. 3,34,64,905 the next year. 

The amount spent on tea every month was Rs. 27,88,742, which translates to Rs. 92,958 a day.  

Mr Nirupam said: ""If the cost of tea is Rs. 5 per cup, then 18,591 cups of tea was consumed - if we are to go by the figure."" 

If there are 252 working days in a year, taking into account holidays and weekends, then Rs. 1,32,801 was spent on tea per day. And if the cost of tea is Rs. 5 per cup then 26,650 cups of tea were consumed, according to the RTI information, Mr Nirupam goes on to calculate. 

""It's a scam. How is it possible that so many cups of tea were consumed?"" said the Mumbai Congress chief, demanding an investigation into the ""chai pe kharcha"". ""Tea was not served but only bills were generated,"" he alleged.  

The BJP retorted that the increased spending on tea was a measure of the Chief Minister's greater popularity compared to Congress ministers in the past. 

Besides, it's not just tea, added BJP leader Ram Kadam. ""This amount includes the cost of tea, snacks, bouquets and mementoes for guests who visit the Chief Minister,"" he told reporters.  

Mr Kadam offered another reason for the hike in tea bills for the Chief Minister's office.  ""Earlier all departments used to pay for tea and snacks expenses for meetings. Now for all meetings held in the CM's office, the bills are paid by the CM's office,"" he told reporters.  India's New Satellite To Boost Armed Forces, Help Moon Mission 
India's very powerful, home-made communications satellite shot off into the blue sky today, leaving a smoky trail, on the back of the heavyweight GSLV rocket. The successful launch by the scientists of space agency ISRO drew praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 2066-ton satellite, built at a cost of Rs. 270 crore, will be able to send and receive signals from hand-held devices. It is expected to be particularly useful for security forces stationed in the remotest corners of the country. The rocket also has a special feature -- a new engine, which, if successful, will be crucial for India's second Moon mission.

Here are the top 10 updates in the GSAT-6A launch: 
Congratulating the scientists, PM Narendra Modi tweeted, ""GSAT-6A, a communication satellite, will provide new possibilities for mobile applications. Proud of @isro for taking the nation towards new heights and a brighter future"".

The GSAT-6A carries one of the largest antennas that has been built by ISRO, said its former chairman Kiran Kumar. The antenna, which has a diameter of 6 meters, will open up like an umbrella once the satellite is in orbit.

The huge size of the antenna gives it more power, which ensures that a two-way exchange of data, voice or video, can be carried out through small hand-held devices from any corner of the country.

The hand-held devices are still being fine-tuned by the defence development agency DRDO. The DRDO hopes to manufacture a number of such devices, which will be given to security personnel deployed in remote areas. 
Around 400 scientists and engineers were called in to help with the launch, which took place from Sriharikota's Satish Dhawan Space Center, located on the coast near Chennai.

The GSLV rocket, which will carry up the communications satellite, was dubbed the ""Naughty Boy"" by ISRO scientists. The 416-plus ton rocket has had a patchy record, with four of its 12 flights ending in failure.

The Vikas engine, for which scientists have high hopes, was named after Vikram Sarabhai, who was considered the father of India's space programme. Vikas is an acronym for Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai.

For this journey, the engine, which works on liquid propellants, was used in the second stage to give the rocket a higher thrust.

This was the first time all three operational rockets of ISRO were on the launch pad in a state of readiness. In the middle of April, ISRO hopes to launch a PSLV with a navigation satellite.

In future, the Vikas engine may become the mainstay of Indian rockets. Depending on its performance, it could even be deployed when India hoists the Chandrayaan-2 mission. Business Affairs India to reap benefits of reforms in next two years: Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant 
India will reap benefits of the structural and institutional reforms in the next couple of years and the clearance for amendments to the new Medical Council Bill will create a large number of jobs, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said today. The government has taken huge amount of structural reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Kant said at the India Economic Conclave hosted by Times Network here today. “We have pushed for a lot of institutional reforms like yesterday the Cabinet passed a new Medical Council Bill. I believe this is going to create a large number of jobs in education and health,” he said. 

The results of these institutional and structural reforms will be seen in the next couple of years, he said, adding that the government has an agenda for a big push for this kind of changes in the economy. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday approved amendments to the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, including removing of the contentious provision of bridge course, which would have allowed practitioners of alternative medicines to pursue allopathy. 

It also approved that the final MBBS examination will be held as a common exam throughout the country and will serve as an exit test to be called the National Exit Test (NEXT). 

Thus, students would not have to appear in a separate exam after MBBS to get licence to practise and ‘NEXT’ would serve as the screening test for doctors with foreign medical qualifications in order to practice in India. India has opened up its economy in a big way and it today attracts the highest foreign direct investment, Kant said. Soon, ride a new Indian Railways toy train at Rewari loco shed 
Tourists and locals would soon be able to enjoy a ride on a new toy train at the Rewari loco shed in Haryana, as part of the Railways’ efforts to develop it as a tourist hotspot, officials said today. Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani, who visited the Rewari section, took the decision that that the visitors have to pay a nominal ticket charge to enjoy the ride on the toy train, which would be just like the one that runs at the National Rail Museum at Chanakyapuri, officials said. 

Lohani said that the electrification of the Rewari station will be completed by May 2018. Rewari is a significant section for railways as the national transporter is planning a first-of-its-kind railway heritage theme park there as part of the Bharat Darshan Scheme of the Ministry of Tourism, officials said. 

Lohani also finalised the details of running a steam engine between Faruknagar and Garhi, which has been a long term demand of the locals there. Lohani also cautioned railways staff to keep their focus on work despite four back to back government holidays. Starting with Ram Navami today, government employees have off days for Good Friday tomorrow followed by the weekend. “It is essential that the focus on safety must not be lost. 

The consecutive four-day office holiday should not result in any laxity in safety measures. Every officer must discuss this aspect with his subordinates in his jurisdiction. We are a 24×7 organisation and must be alert all the times,” he said in a message to all railway staff. Lohani has been travelling extensively across the railway network inspecting and reviewing divisions almost every week. Today, Lohani met the Kerela Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here and then left for the inspection of the Rewari section. Unemployment major challenge for India but reforms would create jobs, says IMF 
Acknowledging that unemployment is a major challenge that India is facing currently, the IMF today exuded confidence that the reforms being carried out in India in the last few years would end up creating new jobs in the country. “Clearly India faces a challenge in terms of providing sufficient employment for a number of people looking for work and particularly young people. But yes, the measures and the reforms that India is undertaking will over medium term create jobs,” the International Monetary Fund spokesperson, Gerry Rice, told reporters at a news conference here. Noting that India has been one of the fastest growing large economies in recent times, he said this has led to improvement in reducing poverty and improvements in living standards. “Our view is that recent reforms, particularly the implementation of GST, national goods and services tax, should help boost efficiency and productivity and overtime will contribute to help them create jobs in the formal sector,” Rice said when asked if India is experiencing jobless growth. 

In addition, the government recently took steps towards labor market flexibility by modifying labor rules. “We think that these reforms will help to increase employment, perhaps not overnight but over the medium term,” he said. And the continuation of micro economic policies, structural forms including reforms in the labor market, will not only boosts India’s long-term growth but create jobs as well, Rice said. “So we think, all of this will help to spur India’s continuing catch up with advanced economies and create many jobs that are needed to employ people who are going to labor force,” Rice said. Deadline for claiming transitional credit extended, Apr-June GSTR-1 dates notified 
The government has extended the date for filling up a form for claiming transitional credit by three months till June 30. Also, the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has notified the deadline for businesses to fill up final sales return form GSTR-1 from April to June. The CBEC has notified the extension of date till June 30 for submitting Form GST Tran-2. It is a transitional form in which businesses have to disclose the deemed credits claimed by them on stock as on the date of implementation of GST. 

“This extension is expected to bring substantial relief to traders who were struggling with system issues for filing the said form,” EY Partner Abhishek Jain said. PwC’s Partner and Leader Indirect Tax Pratik Jain said, this extension is a major relief for the industry, “specifically for those who have to claim deemed credit of opening stock as on July 1, 2017, which have been sold till December 31, 2017.” 

Besides, giving effect to the decision by the GST Council earlier this month, the CBEC has notified the dates for filing GSTR-1. The Council had decided to continue with the present system of return filing till June. Accordingly the GSTR-1 for April will have to be filed by May 31, while that for the month of May by June 10. 

For the month of June, it has to be filed by July 10. “The due dates for filing of GSTR-1 for the months of April, May and June have been significantly curtailed from earlier 40 days to 31 days for April and 10 days for May and June. The businesses now would need to be quite proactive in collation of data and filing of returns within the curtailed timelines,” Jain said. 

He said the dates for filing of GSTR-1 indicates that the monthly return cycle shall soon be back in track. “It may be noted that for these two months, GSTR-3B (summary return) needs to be filed by 20th of the succeeding month, i.e. post filing of Form GSTR-1, which was happening other way round till date. The industry now needs to gear up with monthly compliances and undertaking the reconciliation exercise beforehand,” Jain said. Another good news after 7th Pay Commission! Modi govt notifies doubling of limit of tax-free gratuity to Rs 20 lakh in private sector 
The government today notified doubling of the limit of tax-free gratuity to Rs 20 lakh in private sector. The notification follows changes in the Payment of Gratuity Act which had empowered the government to fix the ceiling of the retirement benefit through an executive order. 

The amendment bill approved by Parliament earlier in the month had also empowered the government to fix the period of maternity leave. 

Accordingly, the central government has fixed the total period of maternity leave in the case of a female employee to 26 weeks. 

After implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission, the ceiling of tax-free gratuity amount for the central government employees was increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The unions have been demanding for inclusion of the change in the Payment of Gratuity Act. 

So far, formal sector workers with five or more years of service are eligible for Rs 10 lakh tax-free gratuity after leaving job or at time of superannuation. 

The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, was enacted to provide for gratuity payment to employees engaged in factories, mines, oilfields, plantations, ports, railway companies, shops or other establishments. 

The law is applicable to employees, who have completed at least five years of continuous service in an establishment that has 10 or more persons. 

The change with respect to maternity leaves comes against the backdrop of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, enhancing the maximum maternity leave period to 26 weeks. General Awareness National Skill Development Fund (NSDF) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)

The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) has given in principal approval to include the ring road project under the Bharatmala Pariyojana scheme. With this, the hurdles are cleared for the Rs 5,000 crore project. The project got a new lease of life after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan met Union minister of road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari at New Delhi on Wednesday. Tom Jose additional chief secretary, labour and water resources and PWD principal secretary G Kamalavardhana Rao also took part in the meeting. The outer ring road aims at connecting the 45-km stretch from Mangalapuram to Vizhinjam . It will be a 6-lane road which will be 60 metres wide. The proposed alignment goes through Mangalapuram, Panthalacode, Kanacode, Vencode, Aruvikkara, Cheriyakonni, Chowallor, Vilappilsala, Killy, Thungampara, Maranallor, Valiyarthala, Mukkampalamoodu, Mudavoorppara, Chavadinada, Venganoor, Kalluvettankuzhi and Vizhinjam. The project not only involves widening of the 45km stretch, but also development of five special zones. Around 1,000 acres will be acquired for the first phase of the project. Sources said that Gadkari has agreed to fund for the project and has asked state to bear 50% of the cost of land acquisition. CM presented the detailed project report of outer ring road prepared by INKEL. Gadkari has suggested state to include components such as value capture financing. Value capture financing aims at making local community contribute a share for the development of the project as they will benefit from it. This includes proposals such as increased property tax in the areas where local community gets the benefit of development. Sources close to the project said that the development of the outer ring road will be a transformational project for the state. “It not only involves development of a corridor, but various zones. Once implemented it will be a model project for the state. The government will have to make special legislations to implement the project,” said an official close to the project. The project will be implemented as a green project incorporating various environment friendly practices. “For example, there will be an artificial stream in the middle of the road at one portion. This will help in rainwater harvesting and recharge of ground water,” officials said. The project also plans to include various innovative methods in land acquisition such as implementation of land bond scheme and co-ownership of land.

The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) has given in principal approval to include the ring road project under the Bharatmala Pariyojana scheme. With this, the hurdles are cleared for the Rs 5,000 crore project.
The project got a new lease of life after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan met Union minister of road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari at New Delhi on Wednesday. Tom Jose additional chief secretary, labour and water resources and PWD principal secretary G Kamalavardhana Rao also took part in the meeting.
The outer ring road aims at connecting the 45-km stretch from Mangalapuram to Vizhinjam . It will be a 6-lane road which will be 60 metres wide. The proposed alignment goes through Mangalapuram, Panthalacode, Kanacode, Vencode, Aruvikkara, Cheriyakonni, Chowallor, Vilappilsala, Killy, Thungampara, Maranallor, Valiyarthala, Mukkampalamoodu, Mudavoorppara, Chavadinada, Venganoor, Kalluvettankuzhi and Vizhinjam. The project not only involves widening of the 45km stretch, but also development of five special zones. Around 1,000 acres will be acquired for the first phase of the project.
Sources said that Gadkari has agreed to fund for the project and has asked state to bear 50% of the cost of land acquisition. CM presented the detailed project report of outer ring road prepared by INKEL. Gadkari has suggested state to include components such as value capture financing. Value capture financing aims at making local community contribute a share for the development of the project as they will benefit from it. This includes proposals such as increased property tax in the areas where local community gets the benefit of development.
Sources close to the project said that the development of the outer ring road will be a transformational project for the state. “It not only involves development of a corridor, but various zones. Once implemented it will be a model project for the state. The government will have to make special legislations to implement the project,” said an official close to the project.
The project will be implemented as a green project incorporating various environment friendly practices. “For example, there will be an artificial stream in the middle of the road at one portion. This will help in rainwater harvesting and recharge of ground water,” officials said.
The project also plans to include various innovative methods in land acquisition such as implementation of land bond scheme and co-ownership of land.
Sources in PWD said that the project was presented to be included in the Bharatmala scheme as state has not got any single project under the recently-introduced scheme. “The state has no ring road. So this project was presented and Union government agreed to fund it,” the official said.",english

Tourists and locals would soon be able to enjoy a ride on a new Indian Railways toy train at the Rewari loco shed in Haryana, as part of the Railways’ efforts to develop it as a tourist hotspot, officials said today. Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani, who visited the Rewari section, took the decision that that the visitors have to pay a nominal ticket charge to enjoy the ride on the toy train, which would be just like the one that runs at the National Rail Museum at Chanakyapuri, officials said. 
Lohani said that the electrification of the Rewari station will be completed by May 2018. Rewari is a significant section for Indian Railways as the national transporter is planning a first-of-its-kind railway heritage theme park there as part of the Bharat Darshan Scheme of the Ministry of Tourism, officials said. 
Lohani also finalised the details of running a steam engine between Faruknagar and Garhi, which has been a long term demand of the locals there. 
Lohani also cautioned Indian Railways staff to keep their focus on work despite four back to back government holidays. Starting with Ram Navami today, government employees have off days for Good Friday tomorrow followed by the weekend. “It is essential that the focus on safety must not be lost. The consecutive four-day office holiday should not result in any laxity in safety measures. Every officer must discuss this aspect with his subordinates in his jurisdiction. We are a 24×7 organisation and must be alert all the times,” he said in a message to all railway staff. READ Train tickets may get costlier as Railways rethinks service charge waiver 
Lohani has been travelling extensively across the railway network inspecting and reviewing divisions almost every week. 
Today, Lohani met the Kerela Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here and then left for the inspection of the Rewari section. Read More

He may be a Union minister, but RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha remains unhindered by the political compulsions of being a constituent of the ruling NDA, which is political adversary of the RJD in Bihar. Kushwaha visited RJD chief Lalu Prasad in AIIMS after the latter was taken there for medical consultation. Earlier, RJD members had joined a programme organised by the RLSP in Patna. After this incident, BJP chief Amit Shah met Kushwaha to caution him against political misadventures against the NDA in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Kushwaha’s visit to Lalu has set many a tongue wagging in Bihar again. 
Rare Compliment Political rivals BJP and CPM may be fighting it out in Kerala, and a recent agitation over acquisition of a 5-acre paddy field in northern Kerala for NH-66 could have intensified the BJP workers’ grouse against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Vijayan was at the receiving end as protesters — a group of CPM rebels and the BJP in the state — strengthened their agitation against a proposed bypass through a paddy field. But when Vijayan met Union Surface Transport Minister and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari earlier this week, the latter was all praise for the CM. Gadkari showered words of appreciation on Vijayan for the progress in the GAIL gas pipeline project, and said that Kerala’s road development would not take place if not under Vijayan. The CM, prominent among those who oppose the BJP and RSS vehemently, seemed extremely happy to receive the compliments from the rival camp. 
Picture Faux Pas Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted a picture of the Buddha while wishing his 6.6 million followers “Happy Mahavir Jayanti”. Twitterati had a field day poking fun at him. One of the Twitter handles also chose to enlighten Tharoor about the pictorial depictions of the two figures. His sermon: “1) Mahavira is depicted naked while Buddha is clothed 2) A Srivatsa is shown on Mahavira’s naked chest 3) He is not shown in Abhaya Mudra (hand raised) like Buddha. He is always shown in Dhyana Padmasana Mudra”. Tharoor tried to wriggle out, admitting his error, but the Tweeple were still at it when last checked.   Tags:",english

In the year leading up to 2019, the Modi-Shah combine hasn’t seemed like the election behemoth it once was. If there were the Northeast wins, there were also the bypoll losses. If the BJP’s expanse now seems total, its bastions, from Uttar Pradesh to Gujarat, showed cracks. If new alliances were forged, old partners pulled away. It was nowhere enough though to threaten Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP president Amit Shah’s prime positions in the power list of 2017-2018 — now No. 1 and No. 2 for two years running. 
What the election shake-ups have done though is give a new lease of life to the Opposition, leaving it looking for a new anchor to rally around. Consequently, three such faces, Sonia Gandhi , Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati , find themselves in the top 10 — the BSP chief zooming all the way up to No. 9 from No. 50 on the strength of the surprise she pulled off in the Uttar Pradesh bypolls. The way Mayawati goes could decide the fate of the 2019 results, as the Samajwadi Party ’s Akhilesh Yadav (No. 14 from No. 64) would happily vouch. 
The weight of the 2019 general election hangs heavy on the list, with new faces coming in and old ones shooting up and down dependent on what they bring to the table 
The weight of the coming general election, in fact, hangs heavy over this list, with YSR Congress Party leader Jagan Mohan Reddy sneaking in at the last minute on the strength of his demand shaking up Andhra Pradesh politics, and upsetting the BJP plans. Tejashwi Yadav is that other new face, having shown the will to fight as father Lalu Prasad gets caught up in court cases, while Jignesh Mevani joins Hardik Patel in the list for exposing the BJP’s weak links in Gujarat. 
As the Dalit vote becomes crucial in the run-up to the coming elections and the farmers’ long march in Maharashtra reflects a brewing anger, expect voices like Mevani’s to get a more national profile. 
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley maintains his position in a year that saw the rolling out of the Goods & Services Tax, the No. 6 to No.7 change telling as much a story about the “revolutionary tax” that wasn’t much of a “revolution”. 
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has had a busy year, with the Doklam standoff and the rollercoaster ties with Pakistan. However, not much of the blame was seen as resting on her shoulders, as reflected in her steadfast, if lower, position on the list. The Chief Minister who faced the most heat, Mehbooba Mufti, however, climbs up on account of it. 
On the other end though, Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal drops out, as the BJP’s Northeast campaign is seen to bear one increasingly dominant face: Himanta Biswa Sarma, who climbs up 10 places. Nirmala Sitharaman enters on the strength of her surprise selection as Defence Minister, but Ram Nath Kovind finds no place in his first year as President, in a reflection of the diminishing role of his post in the face of the BJP’s brute majority. 
Arvind Kejriwal has a great fall, from No. 33 to No. 73, buffeted by successive setbacks and his abject apologies. But as his victory in the Delhi High Court over the disqualification of 20 MLAs showed, the Delhi Chief Minister is not ready to be written off yet. However, the marginalisation of the Aam Aadmi Party means there is space for only one in this list, and Manish Sisodia has been edged out. 
Almost as great a fall has been that of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , who drops from No. 13 to No. 49. The capitulation of the JD(U) to the BJP is near total and the ‘P’ on the mind of the man once seen as possible PM now is ‘Prohibition’. 
There are only two non-political faces in the top 10. And Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra comes in at No. 3, pushing past RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who has ceded space to the Modi-Shah might. The CJI has weathered many storms and an unprecedented dissent from within the ranks this year to hold on, and is headed for some more upheavals as the government and judiciary lock horns over appointments. 
The other non-political name is Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose rise and rise is as noticeable as the eclipse of brother Anil Ambani, who drops out of top 100. The other Ambani on the list now, in fact, is Nita Ambani, who with a say in cricket, football, basketball and the International Olympic Committee, is now one of the most influential people in Indian sport. 
Courtesy the soft power it wields, the film industry brings in the bottom of the list, though Rajinikanth stepped out of the shadows to claim his position by entering politics. As the #MeToo movement swept the world, one of its largest entertainment industries kept its secrets locked up tight — a sign that the toothless tiger, seen but not heard, won’t break away from that slot, somewhere between No. 75 and No.100, anytime soon. Here is THE list of the most powerful Indians 
#1: Narendra Modi, 67 Prime Minister of India 
WHY 
Because every election — Assembly, bypoll or civic polls — fought since 2014 has been fought in his name. Because despite seemingly disruptive economic policies such as demonetisation and GST, and setbacks such as the banking scam and losses in byelections, under him, the Prime Minister’s Office is arguably the most powerful since Indira Gandhi ’s. For coming up with a new communication strategy that involves reaching out directly to the public, especially through his Mann ki Baat and periodic public addresses to children, such as during the recent Board exams. 
POWER PUNCH 
Got heads of 10 ASEAN countries to attend Republic Day celebrations this year that showed India’s growing significance in the powerful grouping. 
WHAT NEXT 
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Will Modi’s popularity help the party tide over factors such as joblessness and anti-incumbency? 
BY THE WAY : Pollyanna, a 1913 novel by Eleanor H Porter, is his favourite book. He loves it for the positive attitude of the main character, Pollyanna Whittier. 
#2: Amit Shah, 53 BJP President 
WHY 
For turning the BJP into a formidable force. Under him, the party is in power in 22 of 29 states, pulling off emphatic wins such as Tripura in 2018 and Uttar Pradesh in 2017. His organisational skills — micro-level planning, bringing in talent, breaking rival groups to expand the party’s base — have forced the Opposition to constantly play catchup. 
POWER PUNCH 
Despite anti-incumbency and a spirited fight by the Opposition, the BJP pulled off a win in Gujarat in which Shah played no small role. He travelled 6,665 km across the state and addressed 31 rallies. 
WHAT NEXT 
The Karnataka Assembly elections. After setbacks in the recent by-elections (the loss in Gorakhpur in UP the biggest of them all), Shah wouldn’t want any other reverses to put the brakes on the party’s run. 
BY THE WAY: Knows his cricket history. At a meeting with general secretaries, he once spoke about it for over two hours. 
#3: Dipak Misra, 64 Chief Justice of India 
WHY 
Because he has asserted the Chief Justice of India’s position as the master of the roster. In November last year, a Constitution bench Misra headed ruled that even where there are allegations against the CJI, the CJI alone can assign cases to different benches and decide the composition of benches. 
POWER PUNCH 
He has weathered every storm, from the Kalikho Pul controversy to the medical college bribery scam. The toughest test was when four of his seniormost colleagues held an unprecedented press conference and attacked him, but CJI Misra stood his ground. 
WHAT NEXT 
He is set to retire on October 2. With many former judges going on to hold post-retirement posts, it will be interesting to see what he decides 
BY THE WAY: CJI takes a keen interest in literature and poetry and actively participates whenever there is a discussion on these topics in the courtroom. 
#4: Mohan Bhagwat, 67 RSS sarsanghchalak 
WHY 
Despite speculation that the BJP has grown too big for the RSS, he remains the most influential person outside the government. The BJP’s parent body continues to drive the government’s sociocultural and educational agenda — the RSS is learnt to have pushed the government to expedite the triple talaq Bill. 
POWER PUNCH 
“Preparing an army takes six to seven months but we (RSS cadres) will be battle ready in two-three days…” Bhagwat had said. Some ministers came out in his support. 
WHAT NEXT 
Bhagwat is determined to see significant movement on the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya before the 2019 elections. In December 2017, 11 days before the Supreme Court was set to begin its final hearing in the Ayodhya case, Bhagwat declared, “On the Ram Janmabhoomi (site), the Ram Mandir alone will be built.” 
BY THE WAY: Was given an honorary doctorate by the Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University for research on gaushalas and cow urine products having medicinal value 
#5: Sonia Gandhi, 71 UPA chairperson 
WHY 
She may have relinquished the presidentship of the Congress after 19 years, but the UPA chairperson — ‘Madam’ to all her colleagues — remains as influential as before. She is the go-to person for Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the anchor which can bring together disparate anti-BJP opposition forces. 
POWER PUNCH 
Amid talks of formation of a non-Congress, non-BJP front by some regional parties and political manoeuvrings by Mamata and old warhorse Pawar, Sonia reached out to likeminded parties over a dinner. The message was clear — that the Congress cannot be sidelined and would lead any possible anti-BJP front. 
WHAT NEXT 
She will play a crucial role in forging alliances either before the 2019 polls or after, and will continue to handhold Rahul to ensure a smooth generational shift in the Congress. 
BY THE WAY: She has given up on many of her favourite foods but coconut water remains on the list. 
#6: Mamata Banerjee, 63 West Bengal Chief Minister 
WHY 
While she remains the most popular mass leader in West Bengal, she has also carved out her space in the national discourse as one ofthe fiercest critics of the Modi government. Not only has she increased her tally from the 2016 Assembly polls, she has also won every state bypoll since and dealt with the Gorkhaland separate statehood movement. 
POWER PUNCH 
Mamata was the first port of call for Telangana CM and TRS leader K Chandrashekar Rao, in his bid to form a national third front. 
WHAT NEXT 
Retaining the TMC’s dominance in the coming panchayat elections. All eyes are also on the role she would play in forging an anti-BJP platform at the national level. 
BY THE WAY: She loves reciting Tagore’s poems. 
Union Home Minister 
WHY 
Considered the second-most powerful minister in the Union Cabinet after the Prime Minister, Singh heads most Group of Ministers (GoMs) on key government proposals. During his tenure, Left Wing Extremism has hit an all-time low. 
POWER PUNCH 
Singh is credited with paving the way for a dialogue with all stakeholders in the Valley by appointing former Intelligence Bureau chief Dineshwar Sharma as interlocutor. 
WHAT NEXT 
He has to contain infiltration from across the border in J&K and will also face challenges in bringing a peaceful solution to the decades-old Naga problem. 
BY THE WAY: Loves driving, and fast. Often seen riding a motorcycle while visiting security camps. 
#8: Arun Jaitley, 65 Union Finance Minister 
WHY 
Because he has stayed the course to remain a key political and economic strategist despite a series of headwinds such as lower growth and banking sector challenges. 
POWER PUNCH 
Announced mega recapitalisation plans of Rs 2.11 lakh crore and other reforms this year. While staying away from announcing an outright populist budget, he kept the focus on the rural and farm sector. 
WHAT NEXT 
After the Punjab National Bank scandal, will have to improve the way state-owned banks are run. Revenue collections from GST and a higher growth trajectory will be his key challenges. 
BY THE WAY: He has a favourite caterer for his Amritsari chole-kulche whom he recommends to friends. 
#9: Yogi Adityanath, 45 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister 
WHY 
Despite the massive setback in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha bypolls in seats vacated by him and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, as head of the country’s most populated state that is key to national politics, he remains powerful. He has so far survived any possible fallout of the results. 
POWER PUNCH 
His government has the backing of 325 MLAs in the Assembly and, before the bypoll setback, he had led the BJP’s sweep in the state’s urban local body elections in December. 
WHAT NEXT 
With the 2019 general elections elections looming, his priority would be to repeat the party’s performance of 2014, when it won 71 of the 80 seats in UP. 
BY THE WAY: He loves swimming and badminton. 
#10: Mukesh Ambani, 60 Chairman, Reliance Industries 
WHY 
Mukesh Ambani made a re-entry into the telecom business through Jio. The venture made significant progress in 2017, reaching a customer base of 16 crore by the end of the year. The latest Forbes ranking of the world’s richest puts Ambani at 19th spot, a jump of 14 places. 
POWER PUNCH 
His launch of Jio phones at an effective cost of ‘zero’ in July 2017 disrupted the highly competitive telecom industry. 
WHAT NEXT 
Has said he wants to take Reliance to the top 20 companies in the world, from its current rank of the ‘106th largest company’ on the Forbes list. 
BY THE WAY: Keeps himself abreast of the latest technology by reading up on it. 
#11: Rahul Gandhi, 47 Congress President 
WHY 
Because he has finally taken over as Congress chief, injecting life into the Grand Old Party. With a year to go for the 2019 polls, Gandhi has positioned himself as a challenger to PM Modi. Having shed the image ofa non-serious politician, Rahul hasn’t been shying away from taking on the BJP. 
POWER PUNCH 
He led his party’s charge in Gujarat. His campaign gave the BJP a scare in Modi and Amit Shah’s home state and demolished the myth that the BJP was unbeatable there. 
WHAT NEXT 
Before the big battle of 2019, he will have to focus all his energy on four key states that go to polls this year. A good showing will give the Congress a decisive push for 2019. 
BY THE WAY: Likes to collect model aircraft kits and assemble them. 
Minister for Road Transport, Highways 
WHY

POWER PUNCH 
The victory in the recent bypolls – the Araria Lok Sabha seat and Jehanabad Assembly seat – has been attributed to their leadership. 
WHAT NEXT 
The party is likely to play a key role in working out Opposition unity. Tejashwi also has the tough task of taking along senior party leaders.

POWER PUNCH 
The comeback win in the Test series against South Africa, after having lost the first two.

Shylaja’s attempts to explain away the move to regularise admissions in Kannur and Karuna medical colleges for the academic year 2016-17 under the pretext of saving “innocent students on humanitarian grounds” betray the government’s desperation to camouflage the interventions she and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan made to protect an erring college management and the students who got admission through the backdoor.
Records in possession of DC show that the Competent Authority, appointed as per the terms of the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regulation and Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance, 2017 to consider the applications, had recommended for regularisation the names of students who had lost their opportunity for no fault of theirs. The list had 44 students of Kannur Medical College and 25 students of Karuna Medical College, Palakkad, after the Authority found that they would have got admission had the college managements presented their documents before the Admission Supervisory Committee before November 7, 2016.
It did so by recreating a scenario of processing of applications with the help of the commissioner of entrance examinations and the director of medical education after collecting documents from the Admission Supervisory Committee. The authority relied on a provision in the ordinance which mandated it to process the applications ‘as per the laws and orders in force applicable for the academic year 2016-17’ to prepare the list and making the recommendations.
Accepting that list and the recommendations would have logically resulted in three follow up actions: one, rejection of the applications of students who would have failed to find a place in the list even if the managements had acted lawfully, two: taking action against the managements which played with the future of students who had merit and who had acted as per the directions of the ASC and three, initiating action against the management for collection of capitation fee.
The health minister, instead of proceeding on the basis of the recommendation of the Competent Authority which was endorsed by the additional chief secretary (health), sought the opinion of the law secretary. And the Chief Minister found every piece of advice by the law secretary who castigated the Competent Authority worthwhile, betraying his interests in the affair. In the end, the government cleared the list with 118 students of Kannur Medical College and 31 of Karuna Medical College, helping 80 more students whom the commissioner of entrance examinations and the Competent Authority did not find eligible.
“This is the same trick the college management played,” the parent of a student who lost a year in the melee told DC. “The college management made the meritorious students victims to protect others. Now, the government is presenting them before the public while their real interest is to protect the management and the undeserving students.” The innocent students are made to suffer for others.”",english

Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari showed a keen interest in the project during a meeting with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday. The night travel ban had hit thousands of motorists in the northern Kerala districts who study or work in Bengaluru
Mr Vijayan and PWD officials had with them four sets of reports prepared by National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) on the elevated highway. A meeting at the Karnataka forest headquarters with Kerala forest and transport officials on March 6 had seen heated exchanges with Karnataka-based environmentalists.
Kerala had appointed a high-power team to chalk out a strategy to solve the issue, which attended the meeting. The next day, Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change inspected the forest stretch. A top official said the most significant challenge before the government was to convince Karnataka forest officials. “There is no option to close the existing highway. Karnataka suggests an alternative highway between Kutta and Gonikoppal constructed at Rs 75 crore,"" he told DC.
""In fact, Karnataka does not lose forest area whereas Kerala stands to lose 12 km – 18 km of forests.” The night travel ban along the Bandipur-Mudumalai and Bandipur-Sultan Bathery Road was imposed on June 3, 2009, by Manoj Kumar Meena, the then Chamarajanagar district collector through NH 212 (Gundlupet-Sulthan Bathery Road) and NH 67 (Gundlupet-Ooty Road), both passing through the Bandipur sanctuary.
The vehicular movement was banned from 10 pm to 6 am for protecting the wildlife from speeding vehicles and both are firm on their respective stands. The Supreme Court will be hearing the case on April 10. Already the expert committee has submitted a report before the Supreme Court. However, a decision is likely only after the Karnataka Assembly elections slated for May 12, considering the new government's stand.",english

Terming demonetisation “an unprecedented attack on the cooperative sector of this country”, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the Kerala government took on the Centre to ensure that the cooperative banks remain unscathed from the impact of note ban. 
“During demonetisation, there was an unprecedented attack on the cooperative sector of this country which is an alternative to the global corporate giants which are making this world a hotspot of conflict,” said Vijayan, adding that it was the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala which took the fight on the issue to the Centre. “Even the Supreme Court had to ask why there was so much hostility towards the cooperative sector. We were able to ensure that not even a rupee deposited in the cooperative banks of the state was lost,” he said. He was speaking at the launch of the book ‘Building Alternatives: The Story of India’s Oldest Construction Workers’ Cooperative’ by Kerala’s Finance Minister Thomas Isaac, and Michelle Williams, Associate Professor at Wits University (Johannesburg). 
Isaac said the primary cooperatives play a vital role in financing Kerala’s agriculture and raise huge deposits, unlike in other states. “About 31 per cent deposits in Kerala are from the primary cooperatives. We have learned big lessons from demonetisation. With demonetisation, no deposits could be withdrawn from cooperatives. The Central government doesn’t accept them as banks unless they give up non-banking activities. That’s not how our societies have come up,” he said. He said this is where the idea of a Kerala Bank emerged from — a large bank integrating district cooperative unions and state cooperative banks. Saying that cooperatives are a way in which small production can survive, economist Prabhat Patnaik said, “Demonetisation not only dealt a heavy blow against the petty production sector but demonetisation was a big blow against cooperative movement in Kerala, a state with a very developed cooperative movement.” For all the latest Business News , download Indian Express App Tags: Share your thoughts Most Read ",english

He said authorities will carry out inspections and will take action in connection with all complaints related to Nokkukooli.
The collector said steps will also be taken to supply of labourers by trade unions . The decision was taken at a district-level committee meeting held on Wednesday. The committee consisted of representatives from labour unions, traders, entrepreneurs, police officers, legislators and labour department officials.
Headload workers do not need to worry about job loss due to enforcement measures as new enterprises and avenues have been opening in the district, where they can find jobs as well as play a pivotal role in the overall industrial growth, the collector added.
Campaigns will be conducted in areas where complaints have been raised about Nokkukooli, said an official with the labour department.
Earlier this month, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had announced in the state assembly that the practice of Nokkukooli will be banned totally, with effect from May 1. There was widespread criticism in the state that Nokkukooli and labour supply have earned a bad name for labourers in Kerala. Nokkukooli is the amount which private parties have to pay to trade unions even if the job is got done through one's own employees or mechanical process, without relying on union workers.
Though the trade unions have agreed to support government's decision to ban Nokkukooli, they also expressed their apprehension whether the increased mechanization in various sectors will affect their future job prospects.",english

New Delhi, Mar 29 
Aiming to improve the ease of doing business in Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the long-standing perception that the state was not very investor-friendly was slowly changing with a slew of measures being undertaken by the Left government. 
Vijayan, 74, who completes two years in office on May 25, said the Kerala government is making efforts for eliminating the unnecessary delay in granting approvals for various investment proposals. 
Seeking to rebrand “God’s own Country” as a preferred investment destination, the CPI-M strongman said the top priority was to create an enabling ecosystem to provide timely clearances in an effective and transparent manner and to ensure that it is maintained. 
He said even though the state lacked sufficient land for attracting investments and setting up infrastructure, the government is trying to provide an appropriate working environment for various companies in the state. 
Rectifying issues 
“As part of Ease of Doing Business, we are rectifying certain complaints which came up. We want to create an investment friendly environment in the state. We are trying to eliminate the unnecessary delay in getting approvals,” he said in an exclusive interview to PTI here. 
“If a decision has not been taken on an application within the time-frame allotted for it, the application will be considered as approved,” he said. 
Vijayan said his government had held discussions with major companies such as Nissan, Intel and Tech Mahindra for investments in the state, days after the first-ever Global Digital Summit in Kerala, #FUTURE conclave that was held in Kochi. Nissan, a Japanese automotive major, is mulling setting up a digital hub in Kerala. 
Acknowledging that there was always a perception of Kerala not being ‘business-friendly” which made investors wary of making huge investments in the state, Vijayan said this was “slowly changing”. “We have only Kerala to market. Other states have enough land that they even provide it free of cost but we don’t have that much area. But we are trying to provide a good working atmosphere and all kinds of assistance from the government. This is what we are planning and we have held discussions with major companies like Nissan, Intel and many more. There is no more a sense of hopelessness in the state,” he said. 
Quantum jump 
Kerala, in the recent months, has been trying to woo investors by showcasing its single window clearance mechanism, educated human power and impressive human development indices. According to the statement on RBI’s regional office available on the website of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Kerala and Lakshadweep received about Rs 1,100 crore FDI equity during the nine-month period from April 2017. 
Vijayan expressed confidence that with the proactive steps taken to improve the business environment in Kerala will improve its rating in ease of doing business vis-a-vis top ranked states in the country. Kerala is aiming to achieve a quantum jump in ‘Ease of doing business’ rankings from 21 to be among the top 10 by next year. 
According to state officials, as part of reforms, an Investment Promotion and Facilitation Cell has been constituted on behalf of the Kerala State Single Window Board and it will be responsible for the smoother interaction with applicants and issuing speedy approvals. 
The Single Window Board will have the power to issue composite clearances that will be binding on all departments and agencies.

To allay the fears of investors, the chief minister also said that the notorious Gawking Wage or the ‘nokkukooli’, as it is known colloquially, will end from May 1.“All trade unions in the state have come out openly against ‘nokkukooli’. We have decided to end this practice from May 1. Some miscreants may still create trouble, but we plan to deal with them with a strong hand. Police have been directed to take strict action against it,” he said. 
‘Nokkukooli’ is an euphemism for extortion by organised labour unions in Kerala under which wages are paid to trade union activists for allowing common householders/ investors/builders to unload belongings/materials using machines or their own labour. 
Land problems 
On land issues coming in the way of investments, Vijayan said acquisition was necessary in the state to fulfil the greater public good, adding that the government understands the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. 
“We are short of land as you know. We understand the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. However, it is necessary that we undertake such acquisitions to fulfil certain public needs. We are ready to provide adequate compensation and rehabilitation considering the plight of those who have to give up their land. People have been cooperative in this regard. People understand that we are not troubling them but we are doing it as we are out of options,” he said. 
Referring to the recent Global Digital Summit held in Kochi, the chief minister said his government was doing its best to develop the Information Technology(IT) sector in the state. “The IT industry organised such an event. Based on their suggestions, we have arranged a special wing at the CM’s office which can stay in touch with various companies. It has been a huge success. Many prominent personalities participated and we expect a change,” Vijayan said. Published on",english

Vijayan, 74, who completes two years in office on May 25, said the Kerala government is making efforts for eliminating the unnecessary delay in granting approvals for various investment proposals.
Seeking to rebrand ""God's own Country"" as a preferred investment destination, the CPI-M strongman said the top priority was to create an enabling ecosystem to provide timely clearances in an effective and transparent manner and to ensure that it is maintained.
He said even though the state lacked sufficient land for attracting investments and setting up infrastructure, the government is trying to provide an appropriate working environment for various companies in the state.

Nissan, a Japanese automotive major, is mulling setting up a digital hub in Kerala.
Acknowledging that there was always a perception of Kerala not being 'business-friendly"" which made investors wary of making huge investments in the state, Vijayan said this was ""slowly changing"".
""Other states have enough land that they even provide it free of cost, but we don't have that much area. However, we are trying to provide a good working atmosphere and all kinds of assistance from the government. We have held discussions with major companies like Nissan, Intel and many more.
""There is no more a sense of hopelessness in the state,"" he said.
Kerala, in the recent months, has been trying to woo investors by showcasing its single window clearance mechanism, educated human power and impressive human development indices.
According to the statement on RBI's regional office available on the website of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Kerala and Lakshadweep received about Rs 1,100 crore FDI equity during the nine-month period from April 2017.
Vijayan expressed confidence that with the proactive steps taken to improve the business environment in Kerala will improve its rating in ease of doing business vis-a-vis top ranked states in the country.

By G S Vasu | Published: 30th March 2018 04:00 AM | Last Updated: 30th March 2018 02:28 AM | A+ A A- | 0 Share Via Email In less than two weeks of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao mooting the idea of an anti-Congress and anti-BJP Federal Front, it has now gone beyond politics though the context could still be the upcoming national election in 2019. Whether such a front will indeed take shape and if so what kind of impact it will have on the electoral outcome is still a matter of conjecture but it has surely opened up a bigger debate on the federal structure of the Indian Constitution. If West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was always in the forefront of taking on the Centre on various issues, her Karnataka counterpart Siddaramaiah went a step further bringing up the North-South equation into public debate, accusing Delhi of denying southern states their rightful share just because they are performing well on various indices. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan joined the issue questioning the logic in having 2011 census data as the basis (instead of 1971) for devolution of net proceeds of Union taxes and duties. States that made significant progress between 1971 and 2011 stand to lose enormously, he said, describing it as a gross injustice. According to him, Kerala receives a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee it contributes to the Union kitty, TN gets 40 paisa, Karnataka 47 paisa while Uttar Pradesh takes `1.79 for 1 rupee it contributes. Andhra Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, the estranged ally of the BJP, supported the argument while KCR cautioned the Centre of this growing feeling among Southern states that they are made to lose out. On the face of it, there appears to be merit in their argument but the substantive question is whether there is anything “federal” about the federal structure of our Constitution or is it just a sham? No Constitution is written in stone and ours is surely not given the number of amendments that were brought about since the time it came into being. And, democracy is not about just having an election once in five years and electing a party of people’s choice. It is about empowerment of people in the real sense and if states indeed do not enjoy territorial integrity or powers that should be vested in them in the normal course, isn’t it time we revisit the issue? Take, for example, the power vested in the Union to impose President’s Rule in states, which collapses both federalism and electoral democracy at one stroke. While invoking it if “there is a grave menace to the peace and tranquility in a state” can be understood, how the provision has been used, rather misused, is too well known. Post 1967 elections, which were not in favour of the Congress, Indira Gandhi brought down governments in many states, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Odisha. The misuse continued thereafter despite multiple judgments by the highest court, the latest being the dismissal of governments by the BJP-led Centre to break the Congress rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. We now get to hear that one of the primary reasons why the Central government is not willing to elevate a Uttarakhand judge to the Supreme Court is because he overturned President’s Rule in that state. As well-known lawyer Rajeev Dhavan points out in his latest book The Constitution of India: Miracle, Surrender, Hope, imposition of President’s Rule was a British practice meant to destroy provincial governments. “The malady of defections exists in both the Union and the States. If answers can be found for the Union without such an Emergency rule, those answers apply equally for the States,” he argues. There are other spheres, too, where the nature of our federal polity comes into question. With as many as 100 items figuring in the Union List and the Concurrent List slowly getting expanded (now more than 50) and considering that states have no legal rights against the overriding powers of the Union, we are bound to be confronted with this argument that we just have a pragmatic federalism overlaid by strong unitary features and, therefore, cannot be called federal in its truest sense. The nationwide uproar over the conduct of a common entrance test for admission to medical colleges (NEET) is another case in point. Education, for many years, was a state subject as entry 11 in the second list. By way of the 42nd amendment, it was made entry 25 in the third list (concurrent). Unless the Centre too intends to have “power” over granting permissions/affiliations and so on for educational institutions, there is no other merit in having education in the concurrent list. Just as the leak of a question paper can happen even if it is a centrally administered test as it could at the state level! And, in a country as diverse as ours how does one expect a student from a small town to compete with an urban-bred one from a well-to-do family and in a position to afford the best possible education? Law and order is a state subject but the Centre has armed itself with enough provisions/agencies to arm twist governments/leaders in states in case it chooses to. One can understand a central agency like the CBI investigating cases that have federal implications and beyond. However, we all know too well as to what for the CBI is used by whichever party is in power at the Centre. Does it really mean, as some argue, that all such provisions are part of an attempt to create a monolithic, unitary state? One way of responding to issues raised by the chief ministers is to dismiss them as being “politically motivated” and being raked up now with an eye on the elections, the immediate one in Karnataka or the bigger battle in 2019. The broader way of looking at it is to seriously examine if there are aspects that are undermining the avowed federal structure that the world’s largest democracy boasts itself of.

It was in 2004 that Chitralekha, a Dalit woman, bought an auto rickshaw on the back of a bank loan and began driving it from the Edat stand in Payyanur in Kannur district of Kerala. But right from the first day, she claimed she was greeted with casteist slurs and abuse by the male members of the rickshaw union affiliated to the CITU, the CPM’s trade union wing. 
“They were all from higher castes and they were opposed to a Dalit woman driving a rickshaw from the same stand. I pleaded with them that I bought the vehicle after taking a bank loan and that I needed to repay it. But they didn’t care,” said Chitralekha. 
Over the years, she claimed that she was threatened, attacked and her vehicle burnt by members of the union in an area known to be a CPM stronghold. Now, a British screenwriter has evinced interest in her long years of struggle, which continues to this day, and plans to make a film based on it. On Tuesday, Chitralekha met Fraser Scott and discussed the idea of a film project based on her life. 
“Theere pratheekshichitila (I never expected),” Chitralekha said over the phone. “I can’t express my happiness. For us to become the subject of a film, it must be God’s grace. It is also a victory against casteist forces.” 
Ace director Shekhar Kapur also shared the Dalit woman’s story on Instagram and wrote. “It’s a story of courage no less than that of Bandit Queen.” 
Chitralekha says the injustice against her by the CITU union began when they used blades to cut the fabric on the back of her rickshaw within days of her driving the vehicle from the stand. She said they were enraged when she took it up to the police following which they publicly warned her from operating the vehicle again. On December 31, 2015, she said that her vehicle was set on fire just a few metres outside her house. 
“They wanted to destroy me financially, economically, in every way. After that, members of the union barged into my house to attack me. And my sister’s husband got slashed in the melee. They used their Dalit members in the attack to escape police scrutiny,” she said. 
Later, the public collected funds to buy a second auto rickshaw for Chitralekha, who said she had no choice but to leave the area for another place. Following a 122-day protest in front of the Kannur collectorate, the previous UDF government offered her a 5-cent land and Rs 5 lakhs to build a house on the plot. But she claimed that the new LDF government, voted to power in 2016, rescinded the financial assistance. She said a local MLA and a Gulf-based NGO were helping her with funds to build a home. 
“Many people wanted to support me during the struggle but they were scared of supporting me openly fearing CPM’s wrath,” she said. 
When asked whether she tried meeting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, she replied, “He is telling ‘kadakku purathu’ (get out) even to the media. How do you think I will be treated?’. 
Meanwhile, the CPM strongly refuted the allegations of Chitralekha and said the party or the CITU was never behind the attacks on her. “At that time itself, we had denied any involvement on our part on attacks on her. She has always had links with the Congress party so she has a motive to say this. Even the burning of her auto rickshaw was questionable. It could have been done by miscreants. It’s still not clear,” said Madhu KP, the CPM area secretary. For all the latest India News , download Indian Express App More Top News",english

Sudhakar Nair March 30, 2018 Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the recent Digital Summit in Kochi | Pinarayi Vijayan's Facebook account 
Aiming to improve the ease of doing business in Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the long-standing perception that the state was not very investor-friendly was slowly changing with a slew of measures being undertaken by the Left government. 
Vijayan, 74, who completes two years in office on May 25, said the Kerala government is making efforts to eliminate the unnecessary delay in granting approvals for various investment proposals. 
Seeking to rebrand ""God's own Country"" as a preferred investment destination, the CPI(M) strongman said the top priority was to create an enabling ecosystem to provide timely clearances in an effective and transparent manner and ensure that it is maintained. 
He said even though the state lacked sufficient land for attracting investments and setting up infrastructure, the government is trying to provide an appropriate working environment for various companies in the state. 
""As part of Ease of Doing Business, we are rectifying certain complaints that came up. We want to create an investment-friendly environment in the state. We are trying to eliminate the unnecessary delay in getting approvals,"" he said in an exclusive interview. 
""If a decision has not been taken on an application within the time frame allotted for it, the application will be considered as approved,"" he said. 
Vijayan said his government had held discussions with major companies such as Nissan, Intel and Tech Mahindra for investments in the state, days after the first-ever Global Digital Summit in Kerala, #FUTURE conclave, that was held in Kochi. 
Nissan, a Japanese automotive major, is mulling setting up a digital hub in Kerala. 
Acknowledging that there was always a perception of Kerala not being 'business-friendly', which made investors wary of making huge investments in the state, Vijayan said this was ""slowly changing."" 
""We have only Kerala to market. Other states have enough land that they even provide it free of cost but we don't have that much area. But we are trying to provide a good working atmosphere and all kinds of assistance from the government. This is what we are planning and we have held discussions with major companies like Nissan, Intel and many more.” 
""There is no more a sense of hopelessness in the state,"" he said. 
Kerala, in the recent months, has been trying to woo investors by showcasing its single window clearance mechanism, educated human power and impressive human development indices. 
According to the statement on RBI's regional office available on the website of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Kerala and Lakshadweep received about Rs 1,100 crore FDI equity during the nine-month period from April 2017. 
Vijayan expressed confidence that the proactive steps taken to improve the business environment in Kerala will improve its rating in ease of doing business vis-a-vis top-ranked states in the country. 
Kerala is aiming to achieve a quantum jump in 'Ease of Doing Business' rankings from 21 to be among the top 10 by next year. 
According to state officials, as part of reforms, an Investment Promotion and Facilitation Cell has been constituted on behalf of the Kerala State Single Window Board and it will be responsible for the smoother interaction with applicants and issuing speedy approvals. 
The Single Window Board will have the power to issue composite clearances that will be binding on all departments and agencies. 
To allay the fears of investors, the chief minister also said that the notorious 'gawking wage' or nokkukooli , as it is known colloquially, will end from May 1. 
""All trade unions in the state have come out openly against nokkukooli . We have decided to end this practice from May 1. Some miscreants may still create trouble, but we plan to deal with them with a strong hand. Police have been directed to take strict action against it,"" he said. 
Nokkukooli is a euphemism for extortion by organised labour unions in Kerala, under which wages are paid to trade union activists for allowing common householders/investors/builders to unload belongings/materials using machines or their own labour. 
On land issues coming in the way of investments, Vijayan said acquisition was necessary in the state to fulfil the greater public good, adding that the government understands the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own.

Cancer treatment at the District General Hospital is going to get a boost with the Linear Accelerator (Linac), installed and ready to be inaugurated. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is expected to inaugurate the facility on April 5, along with the launch of work on the super-specialty block. 
It will be a major facility in the public sector in the district, the first such State Health Services facility. Bringing in cutting-edge technology in cancer care, it will help in enhancing the efficiency of radiation therapy, as high-energy doses can be targeted at deep-seated tumours with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. 
The machine, which had arrived at the hospital in August, was calibrated first and then certified by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board for public use. 
Two radiation physicists and two technicians have been appointed anew for operating the machine, while the rest of the staff requirement was met from the hospital, said superintendent Dr. Anitha. 
The quality of the radiation beam was measured on the basis of various parameters such as the output, flatness and symmetry of the energy beam, said the radiation physicist. The machine works on a treatment planning system software that is planned for individual patients. 
Trial runs with radiation field analysers, termed water phantoms, help in setting up the quality of the beam and ironing out other technical issues. Various types of treatments 
The Linac will be able to provide various types of treatments such as 3D conformal radiation therapy, Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Electron treatment. Treatments will be chosen based on the shape of the tumours. 
So far, the hospital depended on Cobalt therapy, which has an open field of radiation.",english

അടിസ്ഥാനസൗകര്യ വികസനത്തിന് 2050 കോടി രൂപയുടെ പദ്ധതിയാണ് ഇതിനകം എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ നടപ്പാക്കിയത്. അഞ്ചുവർഷംകൊണ്ട് പതിനായിരക്കണക്കിനു കോടി രൂപയുടെ വികസന നിക്ഷേപം എന്ന് സർക്കാർ പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചപ്പോൾ ബജറ്റിനു പുറത്ത് ഇത്ര ഭീമമായ തുക സമാഹരിക്കാൻ കഴിയില്ലെന്നു പറഞ്ഞ് വിമർശിച്ചവരുണ്ട്. 51,000 കോടി രൂപയുടെ പദ്ധതികളാണ് ബജറ്റിനുപുറത്ത് നടപ്പാക്കുമെന്ന് പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചത്. ഇതിൽ 40,000 കോടിയുടെ പ്രോജക്ടുകൾക്ക് ഈ വർഷം അംഗീകാരം നൽകി. 12,600 കോടി രൂപയുടെ പദ്ധതികൾക്ക് തുടക്കമിടാൻ സാധിച്ചു. ഇതിലാണ് റോഡും പാലവും ഫ്ളൈ ഓവറും അടങ്ങുന്ന മരാമത്തുവകുപ്പിന്റെ പദ്ധതികൾ ഉൾപ്പെടുന്നത്. 
കോഴിക്കോട് ബൈപാസിന്റെ പൂർത്തീകരണം, രാമനാട്ടുകര, തൊണ്ടയാട് മേൽപ്പാലങ്ങളുടെ നിർമാണം, മലയോരപാതകളുടെ വികസനം, എറണാകുളം ജില്ലയിലെ വെണ്ടുരുത്തിപാലത്തിന്റെ നിർമാണം, ഇടപ്പള്ളി മേൽപ്പാല നിർമാണം, പാലാരിവട്ടം ഫ്ളൈ ഓവർ തുടങ്ങി നിരവധി നിർമാണ പ്രവർത്തനങ്ങൾ കേരള റോഡ് ഫണ്ട് ബോർഡിന്റെ ഫണ്ടുപയോഗിച്ച് യാഥാർഥ്യമാക്കി. ആലപ്പുഴയിലും കണ്ണൂരിലും കൊല്ലത്തും നഗര റോഡുവികസന പദ്ധതികൾ ആരംഭിക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള നടപടി പുരോഗമിക്കുകയാണ്. 252 കോടി രൂപ ചെലവിൽ 46 കിലോമീറ്റർ ദൈർഘ്യം വരുന്ന 21 റോഡിന്റെ വികസനമാണ് ആലപ്പുഴ നഗര റോഡു വികസന പദ്ധതി. 414 കോടി രൂപ ചെലവിൽ 48 കിലോമീറ്ററോളം ദൈർഘ്യം വരുന്ന 12 റോഡിന്റെ വികസനം കണ്ണൂരിലും യാഥാർഥ്യമാക്കും. ഏഴ് റോഡിന്റെ വികസനമാണ് കൊല്ലം നഗര റോഡു വികസന പദ്ധതിയിൽ നടക്കുക. ഇതിനു പുറമെയാണ് ദേശീയ പാത വികസന പദ്ധതികൾ വേഗത്തിലാക്കാനുള്ള സർക്കാരിന്റെ ഇടപെടലും ബദൽ ഗതാഗത മാർഗങ്ങൾ സാക്ഷാൽക്കരിക്കാനുള്ള ത്വരിത നീക്കങ്ങളും. 
വികസനകാര്യത്തിൽ ജനങ്ങളുടെ അടിസ്ഥാന പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾക്കാണ് മുന്തിയ പരിഗണന ലഭിക്കുന്നത്. ജനപക്ഷത്തുനിന്നുള്ള വികസനകാഴ്ചപ്പാടിനെ അടിസ്ഥാനമാക്കിയുള്ള പദ്ധതികളാണ് സർക്കാർ നടപ്പാക്കിവരുന്നത് എന്നാണ്, വിവാദങ്ങൾ ഉയർത്താൻ ശ്രമിച്ചവർക്ക് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ ആവർത്തിച്ചു നൽകുന്ന മറുപടി. വികസന പദ്ധതികൾ സംബന്ധിച്ച പരാതികളും വിമർശങ്ങളും സഹിഷ്ണുതയോടെ വിലയിരുത്തി പരിഹാരം കാണാൻ ശ്രമിക്കുമ്പോൾത്തന്നെ, പുരോഗതിക്ക് ഒഴിച്ചുകൂടാൻ കഴിയാത്ത വികസനപദ്ധതിളെക്കുറിച്ച് തെറ്റിദ്ധാരണ പരത്തി മുതലെടുപ്പ് നടത്തുന്നവരോട് ഒരു തരത്തിലും സന്ധി ചെയ്യില്ല എന്ന മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുടെ പ്രഖ്യാപനത്തിനു ലഭിക്കുന്ന പിന്തുണയാണ് സാംസ്കാരികമേഖലയിൽനിന്നുള്ള പ്രതികരണങ്ങൾ. 
ഏതാനും സ്ഥാപിത താൽപ്പര്യക്കാർ ചില മാധ്യമങ്ങളുടെ ഒത്താശയോടെ നടത്തുന്ന കുപ്രചാരണങ്ങൾ തള്ളി ജനം സ്വമേധയാ മുന്നോട്ടു വരേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. സ്വാർഥതയിൽ അധിഷ്ഠിതമായ വ്യക്തിതാൽപ്പര്യങ്ങൾ നാടിന്റെ പൊതുവായ പുരോഗതിക്ക് തടസ്സംനിൽക്കുന്നത് അനുവദിക്കരുത്. വരാനിരിക്കുന്ന വാഹനപ്പെരുപ്പം ഉൾക്കൊള്ളാൻ പര്യാപ്തമായ രീതിയിൽ ഗതാഗതമേഖലയിൽ സർക്കാർ നടത്തുന്ന ഇടപെടലുകൾക്ക് കേരളത്തിന്റെയാകെ പിന്തുണയുണ്ട്. എത്ര കോടികൾ കൂട്ടിക്കെട്ടിയാലും എന്തു തന്നെ നുണപ്രചാരണം നടത്തിയാലും തെറ്റായ നീക്കങ്ങൾക്ക് ജനങ്ങൾ കൂട്ടുനിൽക്കില്ല എന്നതുകൊണ്ടാണ്, കീഴാറ്റൂർ സമരത്തിന്റെ സങ്കുചിതവും സ്വാർഥതാൽപ്പര്യ പ്രചോദിതവും ജനവിരുദ്ധവുമായ മറുവശം പുറത്തുകൊണ്ടുവരാനും അവയെ തുറന്നെതിർക്കാനും സാധാരണ ജനങ്ങൾക്കൊപ്പം സാംസ്കാരിക രംഗത്തെ പ്രമുഖരും മുന്നോട്ടുവരുന്നത്, അത് വ്യക്തമായ ചുവരെഴുത്താണ്; ജനവികാരത്തിന്റെ പ്രതിഫലനമാണ് Tags : ",malayalam

കോഴിക്കോട് > വർഗ ഐക്യത്തിന്റെ കാഹളം മുഴക്കി അവർ ചുവടുവച്ചു. ഇരമ്പിയാർത്ത അറബിക്കടൽ സാക്ഷിയായി. തൊഴിലാളിവർഗത്തിന്റെ കരുത്തിൽ തീർത്ത ജനസാഗരത്തിൽ കടപ്പുറം ചെമ്പട്ടണിഞ്ഞു. നവലിബറൽ നയങ്ങൾക്കും വർഗീയതക്കുമെതിരായ പോരാട്ടത്തിൽ നാടിന്റെ കാവൽ ഭടന്മാരാകുമെന്ന് ജനലക്ഷം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചു. നാലുനാൾ നീണ്ട സിഐടിയു അഖിലേന്ത്യാ ജനറൽ കൗൺസിലിന് സമാപനംകുറിച്ച് നടന്ന റാലി ചരിത്രനഗരിയുടെ തൊഴിലാളി വർഗ പാരമ്പര്യത്തിന്റെ വിളംബരമായി. 
ജനറൽ കൗൺസിൽ പൂർത്തിയാക്കി ടാഗോർ സെന്റിനറി ഹാളിലെ മുഹമ്മദ് അമീൻ നഗറിൽനിന്ന് അഖിലേന്ത്യാ നേതാക്കളും ജനറൽ കൗൺസിൽ അംഗങ്ങളും പ്രകടനമായാണ് കടപ്പുറത്തേക്ക് എത്തിയത്. ബാൻഡ് വാദ്യത്തിന്റെ അകമ്പടിയോടെ ജനറൽ കൗൺസിൽ അംഗങ്ങളെ പൊതുസമ്മേളന വേദിയിലേക്ക് ആനയിച്ചു. ശിങ്കാരിമേളത്തിന്റെ അകമ്പടിയോടെ പ്രവർത്തകരും പ്രകടനത്തെ അനുഗമിച്ചു. നിസ്വവർഗത്തിന്റെ മോചനത്തിനായി പൊരുതുന്ന പ്രിയ നേതാക്കളെ കാണാനും അഭിവാദ്യമർപ്പിക്കാനും പ്രവർത്തകർ പാതയോരത്ത് കാത്തുനിന്നു. 
തിങ്കളാഴ്ച ഉച്ചയോടെതന്നെ ജില്ലയുടെ വിവിധ ഭാഗങ്ങളിൽ നിന്നുള്ള തൊഴിലാളികൾ നഗരത്തിലേക്ക് ഒഴുകിത്തുടങ്ങി. കുഞ്ഞോളങ്ങൾപോലെ ഒഴുകിയെത്തിയ അവർ ഒത്തുചേർന്നപ്പോൾ അതൊരു മഹാസാഗരമായി മാറി. വിവിധ യൂണിയനുകളുടെ ബാനറുകൾക്ക് കീഴിൽ പത്തും നൂറും പേർ അണിനിരന്നാണ് പ്രവർത്തകർ എത്തിയത്. ചുമട്ട് തൊഴിലാളികൾ തൊഴിൽവേഷത്തിലാണ് റാലിയിൽ അണിനിരന്നത്. നേതാക്കളും ജനറൽ കൗൺസിൽ അംഗങ്ങളും വേദിയിലെത്തിയിട്ടും ചെറു പ്രകടനങ്ങളുടെ ഒഴുക്ക് നിലച്ചിരുന്നില്ല. ചെങ്കൊടികളുമേന്തിയെത്തിയ അവ ജനസാഗരത്തിൽ അലിഞ്ഞുചേർന്നു.

സംസ്ഥാനം മറ്റൊരു സാമ്പത്തിക തിരിച്ചടിയുടെ കൂടി നിഴലിലാണ്. ജിഎസ്ടിയും കേന്ദ്രനയങ്ങളും സംസ്ഥാനത്തെ സാമ്പത്തികമായി ഞെരുക്കുന്നതിനിടയിൽ അടുത്ത ധനകമീഷൻ ശുപാർശയും സംസ്ഥാനത്തിന് വൻ നഷ്ടം വരുത്തുമെന്നാണ് സൂചന. ഇക്കുറി കേരളം ഒറ്റയ്ക്കല്ല. താരതമ്യേന മെച്ചപ്പെട്ട സാമൂഹ്യവികസന സൂചകങ്ങളും കുടുംബാസൂത്രണമേഖലയിൽ മികവുമുള്ള മറ്റ് ദക്ഷിണേന്ത്യൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളും ഈ പ്രതിസന്ധി അഭിമുഖീകരിക്കുകയാണ്. 
2011ലെ ജനസംഖ്യ ആധാരമാക്കി ശുപാർശകൾ തയ്യാറാക്കാനുള്ള പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷൻ തീരുമാനമാണ് കേരളത്തിനും മറ്റ് ദക്ഷിണേന്ത്യൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്കും വൻ നഷ്ടം വരുത്തുക. കേന്ദ്രവും സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുമായി രാജ്യത്തിന്റെ വരുമാനം വീതംവയ്ക്കുകയാണ് ധനകമീഷന്റെ ഉത്തരവാദിത്തം. 2020 മുതൽ 2025 വരെ അഞ്ചുവർഷം രാജ്യത്ത് നടപ്പാക്കാനുള്ള സാമ്പത്തിക നിർദേശങ്ങളാണ് പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷൻ സമർപ്പിക്കേണ്ടത്. ഇതിന് സ്വീകരിക്കുന്ന മാനദണ്ഡങ്ങൾ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്കുകൂടി സ്വീകാര്യമാകണം എന്നത് ജനാധിപത്യ മര്യാദ. എന്നാൽ, എല്ലാ രംഗത്തും ജനാധിപത്യവിരുദ്ധത മുഖമുദ്രയാക്കിയ ബിജെപി സർക്കാരിനു കീഴിൽ രൂപംകൊണ്ട പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷൻ തീർത്തും ഏകപക്ഷീയ നടപടികളുമായി മുന്നോട്ടു നീങ്ങുകയാണ്. 
കുടുംബാസൂത്രണപരിപാടികൾ വ്യാപകമായി രാജ്യത്ത് നടപ്പാക്കുന്നതിനുമുമ്പുള്ള ജനസംഖ്യാകണക്കെടുപ്പാണ് 1971ലേത്. പതിമൂന്നാം ധനകമീഷൻവരെ 1971ലെ സെൻസസ് കണക്കുകൾ അനുസരിച്ചായിരുന്നു സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്കുള്ള വിഹിതം നിർണയിച്ചിരുന്നത്. പതിനാലാം ധനകമീഷൻ 2011ലെ സെൻസസ് ആധാരമാക്കാനുള്ള ശ്രമം നടത്തിയിരുന്നെങ്കിലും ശക്തമായ പ്രതിഷേധം ഉയർന്നതോടെ ഈ നീക്കം ഭാഗികമായി ഉപേക്ഷിച്ചു. 2011ലെ സെൻസസിന് 10 ശതമാനം അധിക പരിഗണനമാത്രം നൽകിക്കൊണ്ടായിരുന്നു പതിനാലാം ധനകമീഷൻ നിർദേശങ്ങൾ സമർപ്പിച്ചത്. അപ്പോൾത്തന്നെ, തമിഴ്നാടുപോലുള്ള സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്ക് ഇത് വലിയ നഷ്ടമുണ്ടാക്കി. പതിമൂന്നാം ധനകമീഷനെ അപേക്ഷിച്ച് തമിഴ്നാടിന്റെ റവന്യൂ വിഹിതം 19 ശതമാനം വെട്ടിക്കുറച്ചുകൊണ്ടായിരുന്നു പതിനാലാം ധനകമീഷൻ നിർദേശങ്ങൾ. 6000 കോടി രൂപയുടെ കുറവ് ഇങ്ങനെ വന്നു. 
കേന്ദ്ര നികുതിവിഹിതത്തിൽത്തന്നെ കടുത്ത അനീതി നിലനിൽക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. നിലവിൽ നികുതിയിലൂടെയും മറ്റും കേരളം കേന്ദ്രത്തിന് കൊടുക്കുന്ന ഓരോ രൂപയ്ക്കും കേവലം 25 പൈസയാണ് നികുതിവിഹിതമെന്ന നിലയ്ക്ക് തിരികെ ലഭിക്കുന്നത്. തമിഴ്നാടിന്റെ സമാനമായ വിഹിതം 40 പൈസയും കർണാടകത്തിന്റേത് 47 പൈസയുമാണ്. അതേസമയം, ഉത്തർപ്രദേശിന് ഒരു രൂപയ്ക്ക് തിരികെ ലഭിക്കുന്നത് ഒരു രൂപ 79 പൈസയാണ്. പുതിയ നിർദേശം നടപ്പാക്കപ്പെടുകയാണെങ്കിൽ വിഹിതവിതരണത്തിലെ ഈ അസന്തുലിതാവസ്ഥ കൂടുതൽ രൂക്ഷമാകുമെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ അടക്കമുള്ളവർ ചൂണ്ടിക്കാട്ടുന്നു. 
മറ്റ് തരത്തിലും സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്ക് വിനയാകുന്ന നിർദേശങ്ങൾ തയ്യാറാക്കാനും ധനകമീഷനെ സർക്കാർ ചുമതലപ്പെടുത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ റവന്യൂവരുമാനവും ചെലവും തമ്മിലുള്ള അന്തരം പരിഹരിക്കുന്നതിന് കേന്ദ്ര സർക്കാർ നൽകുന്ന പ്രത്യേക സഹായം (റവന്യൂ ഡെഫിസിറ്റ് ഗ്രാന്റ്) സംബന്ധിച്ച പുനഃപരിശോധനയാണ് ഇത്തരത്തിൽ കമീഷന് നൽകിയ മറ്റൊരു പ്രധാന ചുമതല. ഗ്രാന്റ് അവസാനിപ്പിക്കാനുള്ള നീക്കത്തിന്റെ ഭാഗമാണ് ഇതെന്ന് സംശയിക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. ഇതും കേരളത്തിന് തിരിച്ചടിയാകും. 2015‐16ൽ ഈ ഇനത്തിൽ 4300 കോടി രൂപ കേന്ദ്രത്തിൽനിന്ന് കേരളത്തിന് ലഭിച്ചിരുന്നു. സാമൂഹ്യസുരക്ഷാ മേഖലയിലടക്കമുള്ള ഇടപെടലുകൾമൂലം വൻതോതിൽ റവന്യൂ വിടവ് നേരിടുന്ന സംസ്ഥാനമാണ് കേരളം. 
സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ കടമെടുക്കാനുള്ള സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യം കവരാനുള്ള നീക്കമുള്ളതായും സംശയം ഉയരുന്നുണ്ട്. കേന്ദ്രത്തിൽനിന്ന് എടുക്കുന്ന കടം പൂർണമായും അടച്ചുതീർത്താൽ, പിന്നീട് പൊതുവിപണിയിൽനിന്ന് കടമെടുക്കുന്നതിന് സംസ്ഥാനം മുൻകൂർ അനുവാദം തേടേണ്ടതില്ലെന്നാണ് നിലവിലെ വ്യവസ്ഥ. ഈ ഭരണഘടനാ സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യം ഇല്ലാതാക്കാൻ ന്യൂ ഇന്ത്യ‐2022 എന്ന പേരിൽ പദ്ധതി കൊണ്ടുവന്ന് അതിന് ഭരണഘടനാ സാധുത നൽകാനുള്ള ആലോചനയും പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷന്റെ പരിഗണനാവിഷയത്തിലുണ്ട്. 
സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളെ ശിക്ഷിക്കുന്ന ഈ നടപടികൾ ഗുരുതര പ്രത്യാഘാതങ്ങൾക്ക് വഴിവയ്ക്കുമെന്നാണ് വിദഗ്ധർ വിലയിരുത്തുന്നത്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾക്ക് സ്വന്തമായി നികുതിവരുമാനം കണ്ടെത്താനുള്ള സാധ്യത ജിഎസ്ടിയിലൂടെ ഇല്ലാതാക്കിയതിനു പുറമെയാണ് പുതിയ നീക്കമെന്നത് കൂടുതൽ ആപൽക്കരമാകുന്നു. 
ബിജെപി സർക്കാർ വന്നശേഷം നിയമിക്കപ്പെട്ട പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷന്റെ ഈ നീക്കത്തിനു പിന്നിൽ രാഷ്ട്രീയലക്ഷ്യങ്ങളും സംശയിക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. സാമൂഹ്യവളർച്ചയിൽ മുന്നിലും ബിജെപിയുടെ സ്വാധീനത്തിൽ പിന്നിലും നിൽക്കുന്ന തെക്കൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളെ തകർക്കുന്ന നടപടിയാണ് ഇതെന്ന് ചൂണ്ടിക്കാണിക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. തെക്കും വടക്കും ഇന്ത്യകൾ തമ്മിൽ വലിയ ഭിന്നതയ്ക്കും ഇത് ഇടവരുത്താം. ബ്രിട്ടനും സ്കോട്ലൻഡും തമ്മിലും സ്പെയിനും കത്തലൂണിയയും തമ്മിലും രൂപപ്പെട്ട വിഘടനവാദത്തോളമെത്തിയ പ്രശ്നങ്ങൾപോലെ ധനകമീഷന്റെ നടപടി ഇന്ത്യയെയും അപകടത്തിലാക്കിയേക്കാം എന്നുപോലും വിദഗ്ധർ പറയുന്നു. ഏതായാലും കേരളം വെറുതെയിരിക്കുകയല്ല. എപ്പോഴും ജനാധിപത്യവിരുദ്ധ നീക്കങ്ങൾക്കെതിരെ ശക്തമായി പ്രതികരിക്കാറുള്ള സംസ്ഥാനം ഇക്കുറി സർക്കാർ മുൻകൈയോടെതന്നെ ധനകമീഷൻ നീക്കത്തിനെതിരെ പോർമുഖം തുറക്കുകയാണ്. പതിനഞ്ചാം ധനകമീഷന്റെ സംസ്ഥാനവിരുദ്ധ നീക്കങ്ങളെ ചെറുക്കുന്നതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ആലോചിക്കാൻ ദക്ഷിണേന്ത്യൻ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ കൂട്ടായ്മ ഏപ്രിൽ 10ന് തിരുവനന്തപുരത്ത് വിളിച്ചുചേർത്തിരിക്കുകയാണ്. സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ അധികാരങ്ങളും വിഭവങ്ങളും കവരാനുള്ള കേന്ദ്രനീക്കത്തിനെതിരെ രാജ്യമാകെ അണിചേർന്ന് നടത്തേണ്ട പോരാട്ടത്തിന് ഇവിടെനിന്ന് തുടക്കമാകുമെന്ന് പ്രത്യാശിക്കാം Tags : ",malayalam

വികസനപദ്ധതികളുടെ പശ്ചാത്തലത്തിൽ പരിസ്ഥിതിയും വികസനവും തമ്മിലുള്ള ബന്ധം പരിശോധിക്കുന്നതോ അഭിപ്രായം പ്രകടിപ്പിക്കുന്നതോ അപരാധമല്ല. പരിസ്ഥിതിക്കും പരിസരവാസികൾക്കും ഉപദ്രവമാണോ, അത് പരിഹരിക്കാൻ മാർഗങ്ങളുണ്ടോ എന്നെല്ലാം ഒരു പദ്ധതിയുടെ വിലയിരുത്തലിൽ പ്രസക്തമാണ്. മനുഷ്യരും പരിസ്ഥിതിയും ഒരുപോലെ ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടുകിടക്കുന്നതാണ് 'വികസനം'. അതിനാൽ വികസനം സാധ്യമാകുന്നത് ഏതുവിധത്തിലെന്നത് പരിഗണിക്കേണ്ടതാണ്. പ്രകൃതിയെ സംരക്ഷിക്കുന്നതിൽ എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ മുൻഗണന നൽകുന്നു. അത് മറച്ചുവച്ച് പ്രകൃതിയെ നശിപ്പിക്കാൻ നിൽക്കുന്നവരാണ് സംസ്ഥാനഭരണക്കാരെന്ന പ്രതിച്ഛായ വ്യാജമായി സൃഷ്ടിക്കാനാണ് വിരുദ്ധശക്തികളുടെ ശ്രമം. എന്നാൽ, ഇത്രമാത്രം പ്രകൃതിയെ വീണ്ടെടുക്കാനുള്ള പ്രവർത്തനം നടത്തിയ മറ്റൊരു സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാരിനെ ഇന്ത്യയിൽ മറ്റൊരിടത്തും കാണാനാകില്ല. മനുഷ്യൻ അറിഞ്ഞും അറിയാതെയും പ്രകൃതിയുടെ ആവാസവ്യവസ്ഥയിൽ പല പോറലുകളും ഏൽപ്പിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. അവയിൽ പലതും വലിയ മുറിവുകളായി ശേഷിക്കുന്നു. ഇതിനുമധ്യേ ജീവവ്യവസ്ഥ അതിന്റെ പൂർവകാല സ്വാഭാവികസ്ഥിതി കഴിയുന്നത്ര വീണ്ടെടുക്കാനുള്ള പരിശ്രമം 20 മാസത്തെ എൽഡിഎഫ് ഭരണം നടത്തി. അതിന്റെ ഉത്തമദൃഷ്ടാന്തമാണ് പിണറായിസർക്കാർ നടപ്പാക്കുന്ന 'ഹരിതകേരളം പദ്ധതിയും കേരള മിഷനും'. ഇതിന്റെ ഭാഗമായി നൂറുകണക്കിന് കുളങ്ങളും ഡസൺകണക്കിന് പുഴകളും ഇതിനകം സംരക്ഷിക്കപ്പെട്ടു. ജൈവകൃഷി വ്യാപകമാക്കി. നെൽക്കൃഷിയിടം വർധിപ്പിച്ചു. ഭൂമി എന്ന ഗ്രഹത്തിന്റെ നിലനിൽപ്പിനെത്തന്നെ താളംതെറ്റിക്കുന്നതാണ് മലിനീകരണം. അത് മനുഷ്യനെമാത്രമല്ല, മറ്റു ജീവജാലങ്ങളെയും ബാധിക്കുന്നതാണ്. 
ഇവിടെയാണ് സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാർ മുൻകൈയിൽ നടത്തിവരുന്ന മാലിന്യനിർമാർജന പ്രവർത്തനങ്ങളുടെ പ്രസക്തി. വെള്ളം അമൂല്യമാണ്, അത് തെളിനീരായി സംരക്ഷിക്കാനുള്ള പ്രവർത്തനങ്ങളും നടക്കുന്നു. വിവിധ ജീവജാലങ്ങളടങ്ങിയ പ്രകൃതിസഹജമായ പരിസ്ഥിതികളുടെ വൈവിധ്യമാണ് ആവാസവ്യവസ്ഥയുടെ വൈവിധ്യം. അത് സംരക്ഷിക്കാൻ നടപടിയെടുക്കുന്ന കമ്യൂണിസ്റ്റുകാരെയും അവർ നയിക്കുന്ന എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാരിനെയും പരിസ്ഥിതിവിരുദ്ധരും പ്രകൃതിസംരക്ഷണത്തിൽ താൽപ്പര്യമില്ലാത്തവരുമായി ചിത്രീകരിക്കുന്നത് ആടിനെ പട്ടിയാക്കുന്ന അപഹാസ്യതയാണ്. 
കേരളം അഭിമുഖീകരിക്കുന്ന രണ്ടാംതലമുറപ്രശ്നങ്ങളുണ്ട്. അതിൽ പ്രധാനം അഭ്യസ്തവിദ്യരായ പുതിയ തലമുറയ്ക്ക് നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടിൽതന്നെ തൊഴിലവസരങ്ങൾ സൃഷ്ടിക്കാൻ കഴിയുന്നില്ല എന്നതാണ്. അതിന് ഇണങ്ങുന്ന പുത്തൻ തലമുറ വ്യവസായങ്ങൾ വരുന്നതിനും വളരുന്നതിനും വലിയ തോതിൽ സ്വകാര്യനിക്ഷേപം ആകർഷിക്കണം. അതിനുവേണ്ടി പല സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളും സ്വീകരിക്കുന്ന കോർപറേറ്റ് പ്രീണനനയം നമുക്ക് പറ്റില്ല. എന്നാൽ നല്ല റോഡ്, വ്യവസായ പാർക്ക്, വിദഗ്ധതൊഴിലാളികൾ‐ ഇതെല്ലാം നൽകണം. അതുപോലെ നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടുകാർക്ക് ഒരു സ്ഥലത്തുനിന്ന് മറ്റൊരു സ്ഥലത്തേക്ക് ക്ലേശം കൂടാതെയും സമയനഷ്ടം വരാതെയും യാത്രചെയ്യാൻ നല്ല റോഡ് വേണം. കേരളത്തിൽ ഏറ്റവും കൂടുതൽ ആളുകൾ മരണപ്പെടുന്നത് റോഡപകടങ്ങളിലാണ്. ഈ പശ്ചാത്തലത്തിൽ വേണം കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ ഗതാഗതപാതയുടെ പ്രശ്നം പരിഗണിക്കാൻ. ദേശീയപാത വികസനവുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടാണ് തളിപ്പറമ്പ്‐ കീഴാറ്റൂർ ബൈപാസ് നിർമാണം. ഈ വിഷയത്തിൽ സിപിഐ എമ്മിനെ ഒറ്റപ്പെടുത്താനും എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാരിനെ കരിതേച്ചുകാണിക്കാനും ജനങ്ങളെ ഭീതിപ്പെടുത്തുന്ന പ്രചാരണങ്ങളാണ് ചില മാധ്യമങ്ങളെ കൂട്ടുപിടിച്ച് ഒരു വിഭാഗം നടത്തിക്കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നത്. 
നിരവധി പതിറ്റാണ്ടുകളായി മുടങ്ങിക്കിടന്ന ദേശീയപാത 17ന്റെ വികസനം പൂർത്തിയാക്കുമെന്ന് എൽഡിഎഫിന്റെ തെരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പ് പ്രകടനപത്രികയിൽ വാഗ്ദാനം ചെയ്തിട്ടുണ്ട്. ചിലയിടത്ത് ബൈപാസ് വേണ്ടിവരുമെന്നും അത് യുദ്ധകാലാടിസ്ഥാനത്തിൽ പൂർത്തിയാക്കുമെന്നും ചൂണ്ടിക്കാട്ടിയിരുന്നു. റോഡപകടങ്ങൾ കുറയ്ക്കുന്നതിന് ദേശീയപാത വികസനം അത്യന്താപേക്ഷിതമാണ്. റോഡ് വികസനത്തിന് സ്ഥലം ഏറ്റെടുക്കുമ്പോൾ ആ പ്രദേശങ്ങളിലെ ജനങ്ങൾക്ക് പ്രയാസമുണ്ടാകുക സ്വാഭാവികമാണ്. പരിസ്ഥിതിയെ പരമാവധി സംരക്ഷിച്ച് വികസനപ്രവർത്തനം നടത്തുകയെന്നതാണ് ഇടതുപക്ഷത്തിന്റെയും സിപിഐ എമ്മിന്റെയും നയം. തണ്ണീർത്തടങ്ങളും നെൽവയലുകളും സംരക്ഷിക്കുന്നതിന്റെ പ്രാധാന്യം തിരിച്ചറിഞ്ഞാണ് ഇന്ത്യയിൽ ആദ്യമായി അത് സംരക്ഷിക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള നിയമം 2008ലെ എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ പാസാക്കിയത്. വികസനാവശ്യത്തിനുവേണ്ടി കൃഷിഭൂമി ഏറ്റെടുത്താൽ, പകരം ഭൂമിയിൽ കൃഷി അഭിവൃദ്ധിപ്പെടുത്തുകയെന്ന നയം പിണറായി സർക്കാർ നിയമഭേദഗതിയിലൂടെതന്നെ കൊണ്ടുവന്നു. ദേശീയപാത 45 മീറ്ററാക്കിയത് മുഖ്യ രാഷ്ട്രീയപാർടികൾ പങ്കാളികളായ സമവായപ്രകാരമാണ്. 
മലബാർമേഖലയിലെ ഏറ്റവും ഗതാഗതക്കുരുക്ക് നേരിടുന്ന പട്ടണങ്ങളിലൊന്നാണ് തളിപ്പറമ്പ്. ഇവിടെ ബൈപാസിന്റെ ആവശ്യകത ആർക്കും നിഷേധിക്കാനാകില്ല. പരിസ്ഥിതി പരമാവധി സംരക്ഷിച്ചും വീടുകൾ, കെട്ടിടങ്ങൾ, വയലുകൾ എന്നിവയുടെ നാശം ഏറ്റവും കുറഞ്ഞും നേരിടുന്ന അലൈൻമെന്റാണ് ബൈപാസിന് അംഗീകരിക്കേണ്ടതെന്ന് തുടക്കംമുതലേ സിപിഐ എം ചൂണ്ടിക്കാട്ടിയിരുന്നു. തളിപ്പറമ്പ് നഗരം, പൂക്കോത്ത്തെരു, കീഴാറ്റൂർ വയൽ എന്നിവയുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ട മൂന്ന് അലൈൻമെന്റുകളാണ് തയ്യാറാക്കിയത്. തളിപ്പറമ്പ് നഗരംവഴി 298 കെട്ടിടങ്ങളുടെയും പൂക്കോത്ത്തെരു മേഖലവഴി 78 കെട്ടിടങ്ങളുടെയും നാശമാണ് അലൈൻമെന്റിൽ കണക്കാക്കിയിരുന്നത്. എന്നാൽ, കുപ്പം‐ കീഴാറ്റൂർ‐ കൂവോട്‐ കുറ്റിക്കോൽ പ്രദേശത്തുകൂടിയുള്ള ബൈപാസ് നിർമാണം വഴി 28 കെട്ടിടങ്ങൾക്കുമാത്രമേ നാശം സംഭവിക്കുകയുള്ളൂ. ഇത്തരമൊരു സാഹചര്യത്തിലാണ് ഈ അലൈൻമെന്റ് അംഗീകരിക്കുന്നതിന് സാർവത്രികമായ സ്വീകാര്യത ലഭിച്ചത്. കേന്ദ്ര സർക്കാരിന്റെ നിയന്ത്രണത്തിലുള്ള നാഷണൽ ഹൈവേ അതോറിറ്റിയാണ് ഇത് നിശ്ചയിച്ചത്. എന്നാൽ, തണ്ണീർത്തടവും നെൽവയലും നഷ്ടപ്പെടാതിരിക്കാൻ ആകാശപ്പാത (എലിവേറ്റഡ് ഹൈവേ) നിർമിക്കണമെന്ന ആവശ്യം കേന്ദ്ര സർക്കാരിനുമുന്നിൽ സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാർ ഉന്നയിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇക്കാര്യത്തിൽ തീരുമാനമെടുക്കേണ്ടത് കേന്ദ്ര സർക്കാരാണ്. അത് മോഡിസർക്കാരിനെക്കൊണ്ട് ചെയ്യിപ്പിക്കുന്നതിനാണ് കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ സമരത്തിനിറങ്ങിയ ബിജെപിക്കാർ ചെയ്യേണ്ടത്. സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാരിന്റെ നിർദേശത്തിന് കേന്ദ്രത്തിൽനിന്ന് അംഗീകാരം വാങ്ങിയെടുക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള സമ്മർദമാണ് ഡൽഹിയിൽ പോയി ബിജെപിക്കാർ നടത്തേണ്ടത്. അതിനുപകരം എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാരിനെതിരായി ഒരു സമരമുഖം കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ തുറന്നിരിക്കുന്നത് ദുരുദ്ദേശ്യപരമാണ്. ഈ സമരം ഉപതെരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പ്് നടക്കുന്ന ചെങ്ങന്നൂരിലെത്തുമെന്നും ഇക്കൂട്ടർ പറഞ്ഞിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇതിലൂടെ ഇവരുടെ എൽഡിഎഫ് വിരുദ്ധ രാഷ്ട്രീയമാണ് പുറത്തുവന്നിരിക്കുന്നത്. 
കോൺഗ്രസ് നേതാവ് വി എം സുധീരനും ബിജെപി നേതാക്കളായ സുരേഷ്ഗോപിയും ഗോപാലകൃഷ്ണനുമെല്ലാം അവിടെ കൈകോർത്തു. മഹാത്മാഗാന്ധിയെ അല്ല, പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയായിരുന്ന നെഹ്റുവിനെയാണ് ആദ്യം കൊല്ലേണ്ടിയിരുന്നതെന്ന് പ്രസംഗിച്ച സംഘപരിവാറുകാരനാണ് ഗോപാലകൃഷ്ണൻ. അയാളുമായി കൈകോർക്കാൻ സുധീരന് ഉൾവിളിയുണ്ടായത് പിണറായി വിജയൻ സർക്കാരിനെ അസ്ഥിരപ്പെടുത്താനുള്ള മോഹമാണ്. സംസ്ഥാനത്തിന്റെ വിവിധ ഭാഗങ്ങളിൽനിന്ന് ഇറക്കുമതിചെയ്ത ആളുകളുടെ പ്രകടനമായിരുന്നു കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ നടന്നത്. തദ്ദേശവാസികൾ ഇതിനെ ബഹിഷ്കരിച്ചിരുന്നു. ബൈപാസിന് സ്ഥലം വിട്ടുകൊടുക്കേണ്ടത് 60 കുടുംബങ്ങളാണ്. അതിൽ നാലുപേർമാത്രമാണ് സ്ഥലം വിട്ടുനൽകാൻ വിസമ്മതിക്കുന്നത്. ആ നാലുപേരെ മുൻനിർത്തി എല്ലാ ഇടതുപക്ഷവിരുദ്ധരും ചേർന്ന ഒരു മഹാസഖ്യത്തിന് രൂപംകൊടുത്തിരിക്കുകയാണ്. എന്നാൽ, കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ ജനങ്ങളെയാകെ ചേർത്തുകൊണ്ട് മാർച്ച് 24ന് കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽനിന്ന് തളിപ്പറമ്പിലേക്ക് മാർച്ച് നടത്തിയിരുന്നു. അതിൽ പ്രതിഫലിച്ചത് പ്രദേശവാസികളുടെ വികാരമാണ്. വളപട്ടണം‐ ചാല ബൈപാസ് വയൽവഴിയാക്കാൻ കേന്ദ്ര ഉപരിതല ഗതാഗതമന്ത്രിക്ക് നിവേദനം നൽകിയ പി കെ കൃഷ്ണദാസ് കീഴാറ്റൂർസമരത്തിൽ പങ്കാളിയാണെന്നത് പ്രത്യക്ഷത്തിലെ ഇരട്ടത്താപ്പാണ്. കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ സമരം നടത്തുമ്പോൾ കണ്ണൂരിലെ വയൽവഴിയുള്ള അലൈൻമെന്റിന് ദേശീയപാത വികസന അതോറിറ്റി അംഗീകാരം നൽകിയതിനോട് എന്ത് നിലപാടെടുക്കും? 
ഒരുഭാഗത്ത് കണ്ണൂരിനെയും കാസർകോടിനെയും എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ വികസനകാര്യത്തിൽ അവഗണിക്കുന്നുവെന്ന് പ്രചാരണം നടത്തുകയും മറുഭാഗത്ത് റോഡ് ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ള വികസനകാര്യങ്ങൾ വരുമ്പോൾ അതിനെ തടസ്സപ്പെടുത്തുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. ഇങ്ങനെയൊരു ഇരട്ടത്താപ്പാണ് കമ്യൂണിസ്റ്റുവിരുദ്ധ ശക്തികൾ നടത്തുന്നത്. വടക്കെ മലബാറിലെ പിന്നോക്കാവസ്ഥ മാറ്റിയെടുക്കാനുള്ള ക്രിയാത്മകനടപടികൾ എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ സ്വീകരിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. കണ്ണൂർ വിമാനത്താവളം, അഴീക്കോട് തുറമുഖം, ദേശീയപാത വികസനം എന്നീ മേഖലകളിലെല്ലാം നല്ല പരിഗണനയാണ് സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാർ നൽകുന്നത്. ഈ വികസനമുന്നേറ്റത്തെ തകിടംമറിക്കാനുള്ള ദുഷ്ടലാക്കാണ് കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ സമരാഭാസം. തലശേരി‐ മൈസൂർ റെയിൽപ്പാത എ കെ ജി ഉള്ളകാലംമുതൽ ശ്രമിച്ചുവരുന്നതാണ്. കേന്ദ്ര‐ സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാരുകൾ ചേർന്ന് പദ്ധതി ഏറ്റെടുക്കാമെന്ന് സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാർ നിലപാടെടുത്തു. ഇതോടെ പദ്ധതി യാഥാർഥ്യമാകുന്നുവെന്ന് വന്നപ്പോൾ പരിസ്ഥിതിവാദം ഉയർത്തി പദ്ധതി അട്ടിമറിക്കാൻ ചിലർ ശ്രമിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. 
ഇടതുപക്ഷത്തിന്റെ ശക്തികേന്ദ്രങ്ങളിൽ വികസനമില്ലെന്ന് ഒരുവശത്ത് പ്രചരിപ്പിക്കുകയും അതേസമയം, വികസനപദ്ധതികളെ പരിസ്ഥിതിയുടെ പേരുപറഞ്ഞ് അട്ടിമറിക്കാൻ ആളെയിറക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്ന തരംതാണ പണിയാണ് കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ വന്ന വി എം സുധീരനെപ്പോലെയുള്ളവർ ചെയ്യുന്നത്. ആലപ്പുഴയിൽ തീരദേശ റെയിൽവേക്കുവേണ്ടി സമരംചെയ്ത നേതാവാണ് സുധീരൻ. 1977ൽ മൊറാർജി ദേശായി സർക്കാരിന്റെ കാലത്തായിരുന്നു ആ സമരം. അന്നത്തെ കേന്ദ്രത്തിലെ ജനതാപാർടി സർക്കാർ ആലപ്പുഴ തീരദേശ റെയിൽവേ പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചു. ആയിരക്കണക്കിന് ഏക്കർ നെൽവയലുകളിലൂടെയാണ് തീരദേശ റെയിൽവേ യാഥാർഥ്യമായത്. അന്ന് സുധീരന് തോന്നാത്ത പരിസ്ഥിതിബോധം ഇപ്പോൾ കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ തോന്നിയത് എന്തുകൊണ്ടാണ്? തിരുവനന്തപുരം‐ കഴക്കൂട്ടം ബൈപാസ് ഒട്ടും വയൽനികത്താതെയാണോ നിർമിച്ചതെന്ന് സുരേഷ്ഗോപി പറഞ്ഞാൽ കൊള്ളാം. അതിന്റെ നിർമാണവേളയിൽ സുരേഷ്ഗോപി എന്താ മൗനംപാലിച്ചത്? അപ്പോൾ കീഴാറ്റൂരിന്റെ കാര്യത്തിൽ പ്രകടിപ്പിക്കുന്ന താൽപ്പര്യം പരിസ്ഥിതിസംരക്ഷണത്തിന്റേതല്ല, എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാരിന്റെ കാലത്ത് വികസനം പാടിെല്ലന്ന സങ്കുചിത രാഷ്ട്രീയത്തിന്റേതാണ്. 
പരിസ്ഥിതി സംരക്ഷിച്ചുകൊണ്ടുള്ള വികസനമാണ് എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാരിന്റെ നയം. അടിസ്ഥാനസൗകര്യവികസനവും ദേശീയപാത വികസനവും ബൈപാസ് നിർമാണവും യുദ്ധകാലാടിസ്ഥാനത്തിൽ നടപ്പാക്കുമ്പോൾ, ഇതിനുവേണ്ടി സ്ഥലം വിട്ടുകൊടുക്കുന്നവർക്ക് മതിയായ ആശ്വാസനടപടികൾ നൽകും. വികസനത്തിനുവേണ്ടി സ്ഥലം വിട്ടുകൊടുക്കുന്ന കർഷകർക്കും സ്ഥലം ഉടമകൾക്കുമൊപ്പമാണ് സിപിഐ എം. ദേശീയപാതയ്ക്ക് സ്ഥലം ഏറ്റെടുക്കുമ്പോൾ കച്ചവടസ്ഥാപനങ്ങളുണ്ടെങ്കിൽ സ്ഥലം ഉടമയ്ക്കുമാത്രമല്ല, വ്യാപാരിക്കും ആശ്വാസനടപടി ലഭിക്കണമെന്നതാണ് സിപിഐ എം കാഴ്ചപ്പാട്. കണ്ണൂർ ജില്ലയിൽ ഏറ്റവും കൂടുതൽ ഭൂമി ഏറ്റെടുത്തത് കണ്ണൂർ വിമാനത്താവളത്തിനുവേണ്ടിയാണ്. 1996ൽ ഇ കെ നായനാർ സർക്കാരാണ് ഭൂമി ഏറ്റെടുക്കൽപദ്ധതിക്ക് തുടക്കംകുറിച്ചത്. അന്ന് 200 ഏക്കറോളം ഭൂമി ഏറ്റെടുത്തു. പിന്നീടുവന്ന യുഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ ഒരുസെന്റ് ഭൂമിപോലും ഏറ്റെടുത്തില്ല. 2006ൽ വി എസ് സർക്കാർ വന്നപ്പോഴാണ് ഭൂമി ഏറ്റെടുക്കൽനടപടി പുനരാരംഭിച്ചത്. അത് തടസ്സപ്പെടുത്താനും സംഘർഷമുണ്ടാക്കാനും ചില യുഡിഎഫ് നേതാക്കൾ ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ളവർ ആ ഘട്ടത്തിൽ ശ്രമിച്ചിരുന്നു. എന്നാൽ, സ്ഥലം ഉടമസ്ഥരെ വിശ്വാസത്തിലെടുത്ത് പ്രത്യേക പാക്കേജ് പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചപ്പോൾ സ്ഥലം വിട്ടുകൊടുക്കാൻ ഉടമകൾ തയ്യാറായി. അന്ന് എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ ആ നടപടി സ്വീകരിച്ചില്ലായിരുന്നെങ്കിൽ കണ്ണൂർ വിമാനത്താവളം 'ആകാശകുസുമ'മായേനെ. 
വികസനപദ്ധതികൾക്കുവേണ്ടി സ്ഥലം ഏറ്റെടുക്കുമ്പോൾ ചില എതിർപ്പുകൾ ഉണ്ടാവുക സ്വാഭാവികമാണ്. അതിൽ ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടവരെ വിശ്വാസത്തിലെടുത്ത് പരമാവധി ആശ്വാസനടപടികൾ സ്വീകരിച്ച് പ്രശ്നം പരിഹരിക്കുകയാണ് വേണ്ടത്. അടിസ്ഥാനസൗകര്യവികസനം, ഗെയിൽ പദ്ധതി തുടങ്ങിയവയിലെല്ലാം എൽഡിഎഫ് സർക്കാർ സ്വീകരിക്കുന്നത് ഈ നയസമീപനമാണ്. എന്നാൽ, ഇതിനോട് നിസ്സഹകരിച്ച് ദേശീയപാത വികസനത്തെയും മറ്റ് വികസനപരിപാടികളെയും മുടക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള മഹാസഖ്യത്തിനാണ് കീഴാറ്റൂരിന്റെ മറവിൽ കമ്യൂണിസ്റ്റുവിരുദ്ധർ രൂപംകൊടുക്കുന്നത്. സംഘർഷത്തിന്റെ പാതയിലേക്ക് നീങ്ങാൻ കമ്യൂണിസ്റ്റുകാർക്ക് താൽപ്പര്യമില്ല. പക്ഷേ, ഭീഷണിപ്പെടുത്തിയും സമരാഭാസം നടത്തിയും റോഡ് വികസനവും വികസനപദ്ധതികളും മുടക്കാമെന്ന് കരുതുന്നത് ഭാവികേരളത്തിനുനേർക്കുള്ള വെല്ലുവിളിയാണ്. ഇതിന് പ്രബുദ്ധകേരളം കീഴ്പെടില്ല Tags : കീഴാറ്റൂർ മറ്റു വാർത്തകൾ ",malayalam

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan released a book on Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) at an impressive book launch function at India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Thursday. 
Written by Thomass Issac- Kerala Co-operative Minister and Michelle William of South African University, the book explores the possibility of establishing the co-op model as an alternative to capitalist way of organizing business. Titled “Building Alternatives-The story of India’s oldest construction workers’ cooperative”, the book pays glowing tributes to ULCCS for its workers who are also its share-holders. 
Releasing the book Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan lauded his ministerial colleague for having postulated a theory of alternative system in times of increasing gaps between haves and have-nots. 
“ULCCS stands out as a beacon of hope for the collective prosperity with thousands of workers as its members. It stands tall defying the mainstream economists’ pet assumption that no model other than capitalism could endure”, said Vijayan. ULCCS which started with 37 paisa in 1925 has almost completed 95 years, CM added. 
Vijayan also lauded the cooperative movement of Kerala and recalled how during the demonetization the entire co-op sector of the state stood together and challenged the Centre. “We took the matter to the Supreme Court and fought it out successfully there”, he underlined. 
The Chief Minister quoted communist icons including Marx and Lenin arguing that even they thought the cooperative model a precursor to a communist society. 
The occasion had many other notable speakers including Prabhat Patnaik, Balu Aiyer and of course the ULCCS Chairman Rameshen P. 
Prabhat Patnaik – a well-known communist ideologue felt that a true cooperative is not possible in a capitalist system which tries all tricks to stop it from growing and in that sense ULCCS has accomplished wonders staying put and growing for the past 93 years. 
Balu Aiyer, Regional Director of ICA said he was shocked pleasantly when in 2016 he had a chance to see the ULCCS work ethics. He vowed to spread the model to other countries of Asia-Pacific. 
ULCCS Chairman Rameshan P traced the history of ULCCS and expressed happiness to be able to qualify for the attention of an author like state co-operative minister. He also thanked the CM to have consented to release the book on ULCC. 
ULCC MD Shaju S and Mr Kishor were active overseeing the arrangements. The hall was packed with eminent cooperators including NCUI Chief Executive N Satyanarayan. The media especially conneted to Kerala was also present in strength. 
T P Sethumadhavan, Director of ULCCS proposed a vote of thanks.",english

Shah began his fourth round of visit to the poll-bound Karnataka with a tour of old Mysuru areas, asserting that Siddaramaiah and JDS would receive ""biggest shock of their lives"" from the region in the May 12 assembly polls.
""It is said that the BJP is a bit weak here (Old Mysuru region), but after seeing the work of the party workers, I expect Siddaramaiahji and the JD(S) to get the biggest shock of their lives from this (Old) Mysuru region,"" he told a party convention here.
Shah is presently covering the districts of Mysuru, Chamarajanagara, Mandya and Ramanagara, where BJP had not won even a single seat in the previous election. The principal challenger to the ruling Congress is JDS in these districts. Referring to his gaffe at Davanagere earlier this week, Shah said though he had committed a mistake in his speech while referring to Siddaramaiah's corruption, people of the state would not do the same because they knew Siddaramaiah's rule well.

I had made a mistake, but the people of Karnataka will not make it, because they have understood Siddaramaiah's government very well,"" he said. In a slip of the tongue at a press conference at Davangere while attacking the Siddaramaiah dispensation as the ""most corrupt"" one, Shah had said the Yeddyurappa government would get the number one award in corruption.
He had, however, corrected himself after being prompted by BJP MP Prahlad Joshi, who was seated next to him. Shah also accused Siddaramaiah of playing with Karnataka's pride by not celebrating the ""jayanti"" of noted Kannada poet Kuvempu or renowned engineer Sir M Vishveswaraiah. ""Siddaramaiah only remembers to celebrate the jayanti of Tipu Sultan (the 18th-century ruler of Mysore) to get votes,"" he said.
Shah also met the Wadiyar royal family of Mysuru today at their private palace, triggering peculations about their supporting or joining the BJP. According to sources, during the closed door meeting with the scion of royal family or the present titular Maharaja- Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar and Rajamata Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, Shah reportedly discussed various issues, including politics.
Amidst speculations in the media,Yaduveer,the 27th ""King"" of the Wadiyar dynasty,recently ruled out his political entry. ""I have told several times that I'm not interested in politics. There is no chance at all about me joining any party. I'm not interested in politics. Through social work we will continue our relationship with the public,"" he said. Shah also said that his party, if voted to power, would make efforts to hunt down the killers of RSS and BJP workers in Karnataka, and hand out severest of punishment to them. ""I would like to tell the people of the state that Siddaramaiah's time has come to an end.
Soon after BJP forms the next government under Yeddyurappa's leadership, it will make all efforts to hunt down killers (of RSS and BJP workers) from any corner of the world,"" he said. Shah was speaking to reporters after meeting the family of BJP worker Raju, who was hacked to death in March 2016. ""They will be sent to jail and handed out stringent punishment,"" he added.
Shah said Siddaramaiah was mistaken if he and his government thought they could stall saffron ideology from spreading by unleashing violence against BJP and RSS workers. ""In politics, there is no room for violence. If Siddaramaiah and his government think they can stall our ideology from spreading, then he is mistaken,"" he said.
Continuing BJP's bid to reach out to the prominent Lingayat community, Shah began his fourth leg of Karnataka visit by meeting it's prominent pontiff at Suttur Mutt here. ""Took blessings of Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji of Sri Suttur Math in Mysuru,"" he tweeted after his meeting with the seer.
The BJP president had begun his third leg of tour on March 26 by seeking blessings of 111-year old Sri Shivakumara Swami of Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumakuru, a revered seer of the Lingayat community. The meeting with the Lingayat seers is being seen as an attempt to reach out to the Lingayats/Veeshaivas, who are numerically and politically powerful in the state and form a major voter base for the BJP.
The visit assumes significance as it comes in the backdrop of the Siddaramaiah government's move to recommend to the Centre to accord a religious minority tag to Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats in an attempt to wean away a section of them from the BJP.",english

The Janata Dal Secular president also indicated that his grandson Prajwal Revanna may contest in his place from Hassan, if public decides and no other senior leaders of the party was willing to take it up.
""I have decided not to contest for parliament (election), I have asked all leaders from our district if they would like to contest for parliament. They will be given first preference,"" Gowda told reporters in Hassan.
Pointing out that several party leaders have expressed their unwillingness, he said ""What should I do, I have completed 85 years (age).""

""Prajwal is educated and has the capability, but some times he easily gets upset, it is common..,"" he added.
Prajwal, son of Gowda's elder son and senior JD(S) leader H D Revanna, who was until recently involved in party activities as a worker in Hassan district, the family's home turf, was in November appointed state general secretary.
The appointment was then seen as a push to the political aspirations of Prajwal, who has been openly demanding a party ticket for the May 12 assembly elections.
Gowda, however, has repeatedly maintained that only two members from his family - Revanna and Kumaraswamy - will be contesting the polls, in an attempt to wipe out the ""father-sons party"" label attached to the JD(S).
Despite Kumaraswamy, JDS state chief and Gowda's other son, also reiterating the stand on the number of family members contesting on the party's ticket, mixed signals are being sent out from within the family.
Until recently, Anita, Kumaraswamy's wife, had also reportedly expressed her interest in contesting from Channapatna, from where she lost the last time, if the party leadership agrees to it.",english

New Delhi: Aiming to improve the ease of doing business in Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the long-standing perception that the state was not very investor-friendly was slowly changing with a slew of measures being undertaken by the Left government. 
Vijayan, 74, who completes two years in office on May 25, said the Kerala government is making efforts for eliminating the unnecessary delay in granting approvals for various investment proposals. 
Seeking to rebrand “God’s own Country” as a preferred investment destination, the CPI-M strongman said the top priority was to create an enabling ecosystem to provide timely clearances in an effective and transparent manner and to ensure that it is maintained. 
He said even though the state lacked sufficient land for attracting investments and setting up infrastructure, the government is trying to provide an appropriate working environment for various companies in the state. 
“As part of Ease of Doing Business, we are rectifying certain complaints which came up. We want to create an investment friendly environment in the state. We are trying to eliminate the unnecessary delay in getting approvals,” he said in an exclusive interview to PTI here. 
“If a decision has not been taken on an application within the time-frame allotted for it, the application will be considered as approved,” he said. 
Vijayan said his government had held discussions with major companies such as Nissan, Intel and Tech Mahindra for investments in the state, days after the first-ever Global Digital Summit in Kerala, #FUTURE conclave that was held in Kochi. Nissan, a Japanese automotive major, is mulling setting up a digital hub in Kerala. 
Acknowledging that there was always a perception of Kerala not being ‘business-friendly” which made investors wary of making huge investments in the state, Vijayan said this was “slowly changing”. 
“We have only Kerala to market. Other states have enough land that they even provide it free of cost but we don’t have that much area. But we are trying to provide a good working atmosphere and all kinds of assistance from the government. This is what we are planning and we have held discussions with major companies like Nissan, Intel and many more. 
“There is no more a sense of hopelessness in the state,” he said. 
Kerala, in the recent months, has been trying to woo investors by showcasing its single window clearance mechanism, educated human power and impressive human development indices. 
According to the statement on RBI’s regional office available on the website of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Kerala and Lakshadweep received about Rs 1,100 crore FDI equity during the nine-month period from April 2017. 
Vijayan expressed confidence that with the proactive steps taken to improve the business environment in Kerala will improve its rating in ease of doing business vis-a-vis top ranked states in the country. Kerala is aiming to achieve a quantum jump in ‘Ease of doing business’ rankings from 21 to be among the top 10 by next year. 
According to state officials, as part of reforms, an Investment Promotion and Facilitation Cell has been constituted on behalf of the Kerala State Single Window Board and it will be responsible for the smoother interaction with applicants and issuing speedy approvals. 
The Single Window Board will have the power to issue composite clearances that will be binding on all departments and agencies. 
To allay the fears of investors, the chief minister also said that the notorious Gawking Wage or the ‘nokkukooli’, as it is known colloquially, will end from May 1. 
“All trade unions in the state have come out openly against ‘nokkukooli’. We have decided to end this practice from May 1. Some miscreants may still create trouble, but we plan to deal with them with a strong hand. Police have been directed to take strict action against it,” he said. 
‘Nokkukooli’ is an euphemism for extortion by organised labour unions in Kerala under which wages are paid to trade union activists for allowing common householders/ investors/builders to unload belongings/materials using machines or their own labour. 
On land issues coming in the way of investments, Vijayan said acquisition was necessary in the state to fulfil the greater public good, adding that the government understands the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. 
“We are short of land as you know. We understand the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. However, it is necessary that we undertake such acquisitions to fulfil certain public needs. 
“We are ready to provide adequate compensation and rehabilitation considering the plight of those who have to give up their land. People have been cooperative in this regard. People understand that we are not troubling them but we are doing it as we are out of options,” he said. 
Referring to the recent Global Digital Summit held in Kochi, the chief minister said his government was doing its best to develop the Information Technology(IT) sector in the state. 
“The IT industry organised such an event. Based on their suggestions, we have arranged a special wing at the CM’s office which can stay in touch with various companies. It has been a huge success. Many prominent personalities participated and we expect a change,” Vijayan said. (PTI)",english

Supreme Court Judge Kurien Joseph, who was the chief guest, said the dignity of the judiciary arose from the people’s faith in it.

The outcome of the forthcoming byelection in Kerala will reflect the popular resentment against the LDF government in Kerala and the NDA government at the Centre, KPCC president M.M. Hassan has said. 
Addressing a meeting held at the KPCC office here on Saturday to discuss the arrangements for the Janamochana Yatra, he said the LDF rule in Kerala had led to an administrative paralysis. “The Chief Minister is looking the other way, as CPI(M) workers unleash violence and terrorise the people.” 
Mr. Hassan said the communal and fascist agenda of the BJP had worsened the plight of the common man driven to the wall by demonetisation and the introduction of the GST regime. “The Narendra Modi- led NDA government at the Centre and the LDF government in Kerala, headed by Pinarayi Vijayan, are vying with each other to inflict suffering on the masses.” 
DCC president Neyyatinkara Sanal presided. Farmers’ stir 
A press note quoting Mr. Hassan said the KPCC would spearhead an agitation to highlight the plight of farmers in Kerala. 
It said farmers from across the State would picket the Secretariat here on April 4 demanding a roll back of the Central government decision to allow import of cup lump rubber and steps to check the sliding price of cash crops and revise the minimum support price for paddy, coconut and spices. 
The press note also urged the State government to write off farm loans.",english

Vijayan, 73, also said that regional parties are strong these days and that the synergy between them could be used to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) in the general elections due next year. Alleging that the BJP has been destroying the country's democratic norms, the CPI-M veteran, who completes two years in office next May, said co-operation between regional parties was essential to ""defeat those who must be defeated"". The remarks by the lone communist chief minister come against the backdrop of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her Telangana counterpart and Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief K Chandrashekhar Rao kickstarting efforts to form a so-called Federal Front' with or without the Congress. Regional parties are strong these days. Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level, Vijayan told PTI in an exclusive interview here. The draft political resolution adopted at CPI-M's Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress. But, the Committee had said that the main objective of the party is to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party and it will focus on ""mobilising all secular democratic forces for that purpose. Interestingly, on March 30, the CPM announced that it would support the ""strongest candidates"" who would be in a position to defeat the BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka, which might mean even supporting Congress nominees. Continuing his scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Vijayan said secular minds are disturbed by the happenings around the country which would lead to a movement sweeping away the right-wing government from power. Vijayan was in Delhi to attend the Central Committee meeting of the CPI-M early this week. There is a new uprising. Take a look at the farmers' uprising in some states. The states ruled by the BJP are witnessing people's movements, he said. ""Trade unions are agitating. The cultural scene in the country is already in trouble. The youth and the campuses across the country are on streets protesting for their democratic rights. There is a need for a real (political) alternative. The chief minister also said it was saddening that certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of the government, remarks seen as an attack against the Election Commission of India. The poll body faced criticism over its controversial decision to delay the declaration of the Gujarat Asembly polls last year until the last rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""They (BJP) are destroying the Constitutional bodies of the country. Certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of government. This is saddening. Secular minds are disturbed by the happenings. Secularism is in great danger here. A movement will begin in the country which will sweep the BJP away from power,"" he said. ""What we have to focus on now is how is to effect a change. When we are able to show some difference, it brings an overall change. It may not give us any political advantage but we could bring some change by helping to defeat those who must be defeated,"" Vijayan added. Vijayan, while talking about the recent assembly polls in Tripura where the longstanding bastion of the Left Front collapsed in the saffron wave, said it was the Congress party which lost its base there. In the state Assembly elections since 1983, the BJP had never polled more than 2 percent votes in Tripura, except in 1998 when it polled 5.87 percent votes. ""The Centre's show of authority and a huge money flow resulted in BJP coming to power in Tripura, he alleged, adding, The 10 MLAs that the Congress had there now belong to the BJP . He also pointed out that 36 of the BJP candidates fielded in the Tripura election were with the Congress party last time and the grand old party could garner only 1.5 per cent of the vote, when compared to the 36 per cent it got last time. ""The rest went to BJP. It means that the Congress has became BJP. Along with that they joined hands with the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT),"" he said. ""If we look at Uttar Pradesh assembly election last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress contested together. SP had considerable influence there but that was not visible in the election. At the same time Congress lost its deposit at many places,"" he said. Referring to the denial of permission for notices for no-confidence motion against the government in Lok Sabha, Vijayan said democratic norms are getting toppled . Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has cited lack of order in the House for not taking up the notices. ""The Parliament functions as per a procedure. If a no-confidence motion was moved, and has got enough support, then how can one try to stop it? They were saying that the Speaker was not able to ascertain the number of members inside the house. It's ridiculous. This is a black mark on Indian democracy. It's affecting parliamentary democratic system,"" he said.",english

The youth and the campuses across the country are on streets protesting for their democratic rights. There is a need for a real (political) alternative.” The chief minister also said it was saddening that certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a “puppet” in the hands of the government, remarks seen as an attack against the Election Commission of India. The poll body faced criticism over its controversial decision to delay the declaration of the Gujarat Asembly polls last year until the last rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . “They (BJP) are destroying the Constitutional bodies of the country.
Certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of government. This is saddening. Secular minds are disturbed by the happenings. Secularism is in great danger here. A movement will begin in the country which will sweep the BJP away from power,” he said. “What we have to focus on now is how is to effect a change. When we are able to show some difference, it brings an overall change. It may not give us any political advantage but we could bring some change by helping to defeat those who must be defeated,” Vijayan added.
Vijayan, while talking about the recent assembly polls in Tripura where the longstanding bastion of the Left Front collapsed in the saffron wave, said it was the Congress party which lost its base there. In the state Assembly elections since 1983, the BJP had never polled more than 2 percent votes in Tripura, except in 1998 when it polled 5.87 percent votes.
“The Centre’s show of authority and a huge money flow resulted in BJP coming to power in Tripura,” he alleged, adding, “The 10 MLAs that the Congress had there now belong to the BJP”. He also pointed out that 36 of the BJP candidates fielded in the Tripura election were with the Congress party last time and the grand old party could garner only 1.5 per cent of the vote, when compared to the 36 per cent it got last time.
“The rest went to BJP. It means that the Congress has became BJP. Along with that they joined hands with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT),” he said. “If we look at Uttar Pradesh assembly election last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress contested together. SP had considerable influence there but that was not visible in the election. At the same time Congress lost its deposit at many places,” he said.
Referring to the denial of permission for notices for no-confidence motion against the government in Lok Sabha, Vijayan said democratic norms are getting “toppled”.
Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has cited lack of order in the House for not taking up the notices. “The Parliament functions as per a procedure. If a no-confidence motion was moved, and has got enough support, then how can one try to stop it? They were saying that the Speaker was not able to ascertain the number of members inside the house. It’s ridiculous. This is a black mark on Indian democracy. It’s affecting parliamentary democratic system,” he said.

As talks of an anti- BJP front for the next Lok Sabha polls gain ground, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said he is not in favour of joining hands with the Congress to forge an opposition alliance that should be aimed at giving people a “real political alternative”. Vijayan, 73, also said that regional parties are “strong” these days and that the synergy between them could be used to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) in the general elections due next year. 
Alleging that the BJP has been destroying the country’s democratic norms, the CPI-M veteran, who completes two years in office next May, said co-operation between regional parties was essential to “defeat those who must be defeated”. The remarks by the lone communist chief minister come against the backdrop of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her Telangana counterpart and Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief K Chandrashekhar Rao kickstarting efforts to form a so-called ‘Federal Front’ with or without the Congress. 
“Regional parties are strong these days. Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level,”Vijayan told PTI in an exclusive interview here. The draft political resolution adopted at CPI-M’s Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress. But, the Committee had said that the main objective of the party is to “defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party” and it will focus on “mobilising all secular democratic forces” for that purpose. 
Interestingly, on March 30, the CPM announced that it would support the “strongest candidates” who would be in a position to defeat the BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka, which might mean even supporting Congress nominees. Continuing his scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Vijayan said secular minds are disturbed by the happenings around the country which would lead to a movement sweeping away the right-wing government from power.

Addressing reporters here, Archbishop M.Susaipakiam said they were told that the political leadership is busy with their party Congress and other things. ""While the total dead in Kerala on account of Ockhi was 146, the compensation has been handed over to just 49. But in Tamil Nadu, the compensation has been given to 146 dead,"" he said. The Church leadership also demanded that a social audit should be conducted in the way the funds for Ockhi relief and rehabilitation have been spent. Even as the Church says that the total dead is 146, according to the Kerala government figures, 52 people were killed and 91 remain missing. Cyclone Ockhi struck Kerala's southern districts on November 30 last year and the worst affected were two fishing villages in the state capital and a huge majority of the affected belonged to the Latin archdiocese. The Church leadership also pointed out that they have so far spend Rs 14 lakh for medical relief to the affected, besides they have held numerous counselling sessions in the coastal hamlets and that also has cost them a good sum of money. The Kerala government had informed the ongoing assembly session that the process of giving compensation to the families of the missing was underway and it would be done once the formalities are over. It had, in January, announced that while the compensation to the families of the dead would be given Rs 2 million each and the same amount would be given to the families of the fishermen who have gone missing, but only after verification. It had then started giving a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000 each to the families of the missing fishermen.",english

Christians in Kerala celebrated Easter, the day of resurrection of Jesus Christ after crucifixion. 
Devotees thronged churches across the state since the wee hours to attend the special prayers and services held to mark the holy occasion. 
The Syro Malabar Church Archbishop Cardinal Mar George Alencherry led the special Easter prayers and services at St Thomas Forane Church in North Paravur in Kochi while Archbishop M Soosai Packiam presided over the mass at St Josephs cathedral of Latin Catholic rite here. 
As the Easter also marked the culmination of the 40-day-long Lent, during which devotees abstain from worldly pleasures and luxuries, traditional feasts were arranged in most Christian homes. 
Governor Justice (Rtd) P Sathasivam, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala greeted Keralites on the occasion. 
“May the solemn celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ ennoble our hearts with peace and compassion, and motivate us to serve the needy in a spirit of love and harmony,” the Governor said in his message.

(PTI File Photo) खास बातें विजयन ने कहा कि पार्टी का मुख्य उद्देश्य ‘‘भाजपा को हराना’’ है. विजयन ने एक साक्षात्कार में कहा, ‘‘इन दिनों क्षेत्रीय दल मजबूत हैं. CM ने कहा कि कुछ संवैधानिक निकाय 'कठपुतली' की तरह काम कर रहे हैं. 
नई दिल्ली: अगले लोकसभा चुनाव के लिए भाजपा विरोधी मोर्चे को लेकर बातचीत के बढ़ते दौरों के बीच केरल के मुख्यमंत्री पिन्नराई विजयन ने कहा कि वह विपक्ष का गठबंधन बनाने के लिए कांग्रेस से हाथ मिलाने के इच्छुक नहीं हैं और उन्हें लगता है कि इसके बजाय लोगों को ‘‘असली राजनीतिक विकल्प’’ देना उद्देश्य होना चाहिए. विजयन (73) ने कहा कि इन दिनों क्षेत्रीय दल ‘‘मजबूत’’ हैं और अगले वर्ष होने वाले लोकसभा चुनावों में भाजपा का मुकाबला करने के लिये इनके बीच के तालमेल का इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है. 
भाजपा पर लगाया लोकतांत्रिक मान्यताओं को ध्वस्त करने का आरोप भाजपा पर देश की लोकतांत्रिक मान्यताओं को ध्वस्त करने का आरोप लगाते हुए माकपा के वरिष्ठ नेता ने कहा कि जिन लोगों को हराना अत्यावश्यक हो उन्हें हराने के लिये क्षेत्रीय दलों के बीच सहयोग जरूरी है. पश्चिम बंगाल की मुख्यमंत्री ममता बनर्जी और उनके तेलंगाना के अपने समकक्ष तथा तेलंगाना राष्ट्र समिति के अध्यक्ष के चंद्रशेखर राव के कांग्रेस या कांग्रेस के बगैर ऐसा संघीय मोर्चा बनाने के प्रयासों की पृष्ठभूमि में विजयन का यह बयान आया है. 
इन दिनों क्षेत्रीय दल मजबूत विजयन ने यहां एक विशेष साक्षात्कार में कहा, ‘‘इन दिनों क्षेत्रीय दल मजबूत हैं. असली राजनीतिक विकल्प के लिये चुनावों के दौरान क्षेत्रीय विकल्प पर विचार किया जा सकता है. राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर किसी एक खास पार्टी से हाथ मिलाने का कोई औचित्य नहीं है.’’ इस साल जनवरी में माकपा की केंद्रीय समिति द्वारा मंजूर किये गए मसौदा राजनीतिक प्रस्ताव में कांग्रेस के साथ किसी भी तरह के चुनावी गठजोड़ या समझौते को खारिज किया गया था. 
पार्टी का मुख्य उद्देश्य भाजपा को हराना समिति ने लेकिन कहा था कि पार्टी का मुख्य उद्देश्य ‘‘भारतीय जनता पार्टी को हराना’’ है और वह इस मकसद के लिये सभी ‘‘लोकतांत्रिक ताकतों को संगठित करेगी.’’ रोचक बात यह है कि माकपा ने 30 मार्च को घोषणा की थी कि वह कर्नाटक में आगामी विधानसभा चुनावों के दौरान भाजपा को हराने के लिये ‘‘सबसे मजबूत उम्मीदवार’’ का समर्थन करेगी जिसका मतलब कांग्रेस उम्मीदवार का समर्थन करना भी हो सकता है. 
कुछ संवैधानिक निकाय 'कठपुतली' की तरह काम कर रहे हैं भाजपा के नेतृत्व वाली राजग सरकार पर करारा हमला जारी रखते हुए विजयन ने कहा कि सभी धर्मनिरपेक्ष लोग देश में हो रही घटनाओं से व्यथित हैं और यही एक आंदोलन में बदलकर दक्षिण-पंथी सरकार को सत्ता से बाहर करेगा. इस हफ्ते की शुरुआत में माकपा की केंद्रीय समिति की बैठक में शामिल होने विजयन दिल्ली आए थे. मुख्यमंत्री ने यह भी कहा कि यह दुखद है कि कुछ संवैधानिक निकाय सरकार के हाथों की ‘‘कठपुतली’’ की तरह काम कर रहे हैं. उनके इस बयान को निर्वाचन आयोग पर निशाने के तौर पर देखा जा रहा है.

Governmental non-performance in Kerala and electoral devastation in Tripura gave the CPM its unfinest hour in history. Just then the imaginative leadership of the All India Kisan Sabha miraculously pushed it into its finest hour; the Nasik-Mumbai Long March of some 50,000 farmers marked a milestone in the political annals of the country. The lesson is obvious: the CPM as presently constituted and led has become irrelevant, but so many people are oppressed that a well-conceived movement pursuing socialist egalitarianism can emerge as a winner. 
People are ready as public reactions to the Long March showed. In some areas locals showered flowers on the marchers. In some other places NGOs and residents welfare associations lined up to give them food and water. Traffic police went out of their way to say that the march never created bottlenecks; in crowded areas the marchers took to the road past midnight so that citizens wouldn’t be inconvenienced. All this while the farmers developed swollen eyes, foot blisters, dehydration and blood pressure problems. 
The success of the Kisan Sabha’s march could be attributed to (a) the people-friendly style in which it was conducted, and (b) a growing feeling among citizens that some basic changes in the polity are overdue. The time has come for Indian communism to recognise this and alter its course. Lenin altered Marx. Stalin altered Lenin. Mao altered everything while Deng Hsiaoping altered Mao himself. During these tumultuous alterations that brought progress, Indian Communists stuck to imitations with shameful slogans such as “China’s Chairman is Our Chairman”. Can’t India’s Marxists work out a “communism with Indian characteristics”? 
Perhaps they can start by looking at the way Europe’s Communists changed themselves to fit into the temper of the democratic systems in which they lived. Adjuncts to Soviet communism as India was, they saw sense in Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci’s argument that sectarianism must give way to social alliances that sought social reforms. 
The concept of “another democratic way to socialism” gained ground. Inspiration came also from the Prague Spring of 1968 when the Soviet Union ruthlessly crushed a popular movement for reform in Czechoslovakia. 
Old-style ruthlessness was the backbone of old-style communism. Even in its heyday state terror was unacceptable to people (Stalin’s purges and Mao’s cultural revolution will remain historical landmarks of horror.) On the other hand, the appeal of socialism and democracy grew in strength. The influential Communist Parties of Italy and Spain embraced 
“Eurocommunism”. After the Soviet Union disappeared, the French Communist Party also toyed with Euro. The Communists of Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria are Euro-communists. The collapse of the Soviet Union made traditional communism more palpably irrelevant. India is the only country in the world where the old-style communism of the Soviet era survives. That’s a shame. 
Eurocommunism was part of the effort to move away from the unpleasant connotations the very term “communism” acquired through repressions in communist countries. Today China and Vietnam are the only countries where a Communist Party, named as such, rules. Other countries have embraced the more acceptable term of socialism. Germany’s Social Democratic Party was born out of the General Workers Union in 1875. Communists and revisionists within its fold carried on a prolonged battle. The revisionists eventually won with their argument that social and economic justice for the working class can be achieved through democratic elections without violent class struggles. 
This is the line India’s Communists must now formally and ideologically adopt. By participating in electoral politics, they have effectively accepted the democratic system in preference to B.T. Ranadive’s revolution thesis. But they have not reaped the benefits because they are caught in old-style theoretical polemics of the Prakash Karat-type on the one hand and luxury-lovers of the Pinarayi Vijayan-type on the other. (Karat’s explanation of the Tripura debacle was so laboured that it sounded like saying that the CPM lost because it didn’t get votes. Vijayan’s Cabinet decided recently to buy 35 Innova Crysta SUVs costing about Rs 10 crores for Ministers.) 
The best way out is to leave the CPM for theoreticians and lovers of the good life. Others could follow the European model and float a new party devoted to socialism and democracy. Constructive revisionism could save the essence of the communist dream by adapting it to the moods and needs of the present times.That is what the Kisan Sabha did. That’s why those who led the Long March must now lead India to Indocommunism. Over to Ashok Dhawale, Jiva Gavit, Ajit Nawale, Kisan Gujar, Vijoo Krishnan. Search:",english

Normal life in Kerala is expected to be affected on Monday in view of a 24-hour general strike called by various trade unions demanding rollback of a central government order allowing fixed term employment across sectors. 
The strike call given by 16 trade unions under the banner of United Trade Union will begin tonight, CITU State President Anathalavattom Anandan said in a statement. 
Employees of the state and central government offices such as banks and BSNL are expected to take part in the stir. 
Public transport vehicles including state-owned KSRTC buses will stay off the roads tomorrow. 
CITU, INTUC, AITUC, STU, HMS, UTUC are among the major unions that have joined the protest call. 
Workers would take out protest demonstrations in different places across the state as part of the agitation against the new labour law of the Centre. 
The Centre had amended the Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Central Rules, 1946, through a gazette notification on March 16 that virtually gives the employer the right to 'hire and fire' workers, Anandan alleged. 
Meanwhile, Kerala Union of Working Journalists extended support to the strike call.",english

As talks of an anti-BJP front for the next Lok Sabha polls gain ground, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said he is not in favour of joining hands with the Congress to forge an Opposition alliance that should be aimed at giving people a “real political alternative”.
Vijayan, 73, also said that regional parties are “strong” these days and that the synergy between them could be used to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the General Election due next year.
Alleging that the BJP has been destroying the country’s democratic norms, the CPI-M veteran, who completes two years in office next May, said co-operation between regional parties was essential to “defeat those who must be defeated”.
The remarks by the lone communist Chief Minister come against the backdrop of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her Telangana counterpart and Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief K Chandrashekhar Rao kickstarting efforts to form a so-called ‘Federal Front’ with or without the Congress.
“Regional parties are strong these days. Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level,” Vijayan told PTI in an exclusive interview here.
The draft political resolution adopted at CPI-M’s Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress.
But, the Committee had said that the main objective of the party is to “defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party” and it will focus on “mobilising all secular democratic forces” for that purpose.
Interestingly, on March 30, the CPM announced that it would support the “strongest candidates” who would be in a position to defeat the BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka, which might mean even supporting Congress nominees.
Continuing his scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Vijayan said secular minds are disturbed by the happenings around the country which would lead to a movement sweeping away the right-wing government from power.
Vijayan was in Delhi to attend the Central Committee meeting of the CPI-M early this week.
“There is a new uprising. Take a look at the farmers’ uprising in some states. The states ruled by the BJP are witnessing people’s movements,” he said.
“Trade unions are agitating. The cultural scene in the country is already in trouble. The youth and the campuses across the country are on streets protesting for their democratic rights. There is a need for a real (political) alternative.” The Chief Minister also said it was saddening that certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a “puppet” in the hands of the government, remarks seen as an attack against the Election Commission of India.
The poll body faced criticism over its controversial decision to delay the declaration of the Gujarat Asembly polls last year until the last rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“They (BJP) are destroying the Constitutional bodies of the country. Certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of government. This is saddening. Secular minds are disturbed by the happenings. Secularism is in great danger here. A movement will begin in the country which will sweep the BJP away from power,” he said.
“What we have to focus on now is how is to effect a change. When we are able to show some difference, it brings an overall change. It may not give us any political advantage but we could bring some change by helping to defeat those who must be defeated,” Vijayan added.
Vijayan, while talking about the recent assembly polls in Tripura where the longstanding bastion of the Left Front collapsed in the saffron wave, said it was the Congress party which lost its base there.
In the state Assembly elections since 1983, the BJP had never polled more than 2 percent votes in Tripura, except in 1998 when it polled 5.87 percent votes.
“The Centre’s show of authority and a huge money flow resulted in BJP coming to power in Tripura,” he alleged, adding, “The 10 MLAs that the Congress had there now belong to the BJP”.
He also pointed out that 36 of the BJP candidates fielded in the Tripura election were with the Congress party last time and the grand old party could garner only 1.5 per cent of the vote, when compared to the 36 per cent it got last time.
“The rest went to BJP. It means that the Congress has became BJP. Along with that they joined hands with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT),” he said.
“If we look at Uttar Pradesh Assembly election last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress contested together. The SP had considerable influence there but that was not visible in the election. At the same time, the Congress lost its deposit at many places,” he said.
Referring to the denial of permission for notices for no-confidence motion against the government in the Lok Sabha, Vijayan said democratic norms are getting “toppled”.
Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has cited lack of order in the House for not taking up the notices.
“The Parliament functions as per a procedure. If a no-confidence motion was moved, and has got enough support, then how can one try to stop it? They were saying that the Speaker was not able to ascertain the number of members inside the house. It’s ridiculous. This is a black mark on Indian democracy. It’s affecting parliamentary democratic system,” he said. PTI",english

In the state Assembly elections since 1983, the BJP had never polled more than 2 percent votes in Tripura, except in 1998 when it polled 5.87 percent votes. “The Centre’s show of authority and a huge money flow resulted in BJP coming to power in Tripura,” he alleged, adding, “The 10 MLAs that the Congress had there now belong to the BJP”. He also pointed out that 36 of the BJP candidates fielded in the Tripura election were with the Congress party last time and the grand old party could garner only 1.5 per cent of the vote, when compared to the 36 per cent it got last time. 
“The rest went to BJP. It means that the Congress has became BJP. Along with that they joined hands with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT),” he said. “If we look at Uttar Pradesh assembly election last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress contested together. SP had considerable influence there but that was not visible in the election. At the same time Congress lost its deposit at many places,” he said. 
Referring to the denial of permission for notices for no-confidence motion against the government in Lok Sabha, Vijayan said democratic norms are getting “toppled”. Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has cited lack of order in the House for not taking up the notices. “The Parliament functions as per a procedure. If a no-confidence motion was moved, and has got enough support, then how can one try to stop it? They were saying that the Speaker was not able to ascertain the number of members inside the house. It’s ridiculous. This is a black mark on Indian democracy. It’s affecting parliamentary democratic system,” he said.   Pinarayi Vijayan not in favour of joining hands with Congress",english

Christians in Kerala on Sunday celebrated Easter, the day of resurrection of Jesus Christ after crucifixion, with religious fervour and traditional enthusiasm. Cutting across denominations, devotees thronged churches across the state since the wee hours to attend the special prayers and services held to mark the holy occasion. 
While leading the masses, bishops and priests imparted the message of hope and spiritual revival to them. The Syro Malabar Church Archbishop Cardinal Mar George Alencherry led the special Easter prayers and services at St Thomas Forane Church in North Paravur in Kochi while Archbishop M Soosai Packiam presided over the mass at St Josephs cathedral of Latin Catholic rite here. As the Easter also marked the culmination of the 40-day-long Lent, during which devotees abstain from worldly pleasures and luxuries, traditional feasts were arranged in most Christian homes. 
Governor Justice (Rtd) P Sathasivam, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala greeted Keralites on the occasion. ""May the solemn celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ ennoble our hearts with peace and compassion, and motivate us to serve the needy in a spirit of love and harmony,"" the Governor said in his message.

He revealed that he is not in favour of joining hands with the Congress as he believes that such an alliance cannot be a “real political alternative”. 
According to the Kerala CM, regional parties are pretty strong these days and an understanding between would be enough to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) in the Lok Sabha elections due next year. “Regional parties are strong these days. Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level,” he said. Vijayan also alleged that the BJP has been destroying the country’s democratic norms. It must be noted that the Kerala CM has spoken his mind out at a time when West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee has been planning to form a ‘Federal Front’ with or without the Congress.

Alleging that the BJP has been destroying the country's democratic norms, the CPI-M veteran, who completes two years in office next May, said co-operation between regional parties was essential to ""defeat those who must be defeated"".
The remarks by the lone communist chief minister come against the backdrop of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her Telangana counterpart and Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief K Chandrashekhar Rao kickstarting efforts to form a so-called ‘Federal Front' with or without the Congress.

Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level,”Vijayan told PTI in an exclusive interview here.
The draft political resolution adopted at CPI-M's Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress.
But, the Committee had said that the main objective of the party is to “defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party” and it will focus on ""mobilising all secular democratic forces” for that purpose.
Interestingly, on March 30, the CPM announced that it would support the ""strongest candidates"" who would be in a position to defeat the BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka, which might mean even supporting Congress nominees.
Continuing his scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Vijayan said secular minds are disturbed by the happenings around the country which would lead to a movement sweeping away the right-wing government from power.
Vijayan was in Delhi to attend the Central Committee meeting of the CPI-M early this week.
“There is a new uprising. Take a look at the farmers' uprising in some states. The states ruled by the BJP are witnessing people's movements,” he said.
""Trade unions are agitating. The cultural scene in the country is already in trouble. The youth and the campuses across the country are on streets protesting for their democratic rights. There is a need for a real (political) alternative.”
The chief minister also said it was saddening that certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a “puppet” in the hands of the government, remarks seen as an attack against the Election Commission of India.
The poll body faced criticism over its controversial decision to delay the declaration of the Gujarat Asembly polls last year until the last rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""They (BJP) are destroying the Constitutional bodies of the country. Certain Constitutional bodies have been acting as a puppet in the hands of government. This is saddening. Secular minds are disturbed by the happenings. Secularism is in great danger here. A movement will begin in the country which will sweep the BJP away from power,"" he said.
""What we have to focus on now is how is to effect a change. When we are able to show some difference, it brings an overall change. It may not give us any political advantage but we could bring some change by helping to defeat those who must be defeated,"" Vijayan added.
Vijayan, while talking about the recent assembly polls in Tripura where the longstanding bastion of the Left Front collapsed in the saffron wave, said it was the Congress party which lost its base there.
In the state Assembly elections since 1983, the BJP had never polled more than 2 percent votes in Tripura, except in 1998 when it polled 5.87 percent votes.
""The Centre's show of authority and a huge money flow resulted in BJP coming to power in Tripura,” he alleged, adding, “The 10 MLAs that the Congress had there now belong to the BJP”.
He also pointed out that 36 of the BJP candidates fielded in the Tripura election were with the Congress party last time and the grand old party could garner only 1.5 per cent of the vote, when compared to the 36 per cent it got last time.
""The rest went to BJP. It means that the Congress has became BJP. Along with that they joined hands with the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT),"" he said.
""If we look at Uttar Pradesh assembly election last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress contested together. SP had considerable influence there but that was not visible in the election. At the same time Congress lost its deposit at many places,"" he said.
Referring to the denial of permission for notices for no-confidence motion against the government in Lok Sabha, Vijayan said democratic norms are getting “toppled”.
Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has cited lack of order in the House for not taking up the notices.
""The Parliament functions as per a procedure. If a no-confidence motion was moved, and has got enough support, then how can one try to stop it? They were saying that the Speaker was not able to ascertain the number of members inside the house. It's ridiculous. This is a black mark on Indian democracy. It's affecting parliamentary democratic system,"" he said.",english

We continue to work closely with our friends in the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation to ensure a streamlined and orderly process for recruitment of Indian workers and professionals into UAE,” Navdeep Singh Suri, Ambassador of India to the UAE, stated. The UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) announced in a series of tweets that it had postponed the good conduct certificate requirement till more information released following which it took down the tweets.

The government announced on 4th February that newcomers to the country necessarily need to provide a good conduct certificate or police clearance certificate before they seek a job in the UAE. When the decision was announced, the committee in charge of implementing the Cabinet resolution said the action fell under the framework of the efforts of the UAE government to create “a safer and more sustainable society”. The certificate must be issued by the country of origin of the person, or the country where he/she has been residing in for the past five years. It should then be ratified by the state’s mission, as well as the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. The certificate will only be applicable for the worker concerned and not his/her dependents. Those coming to the country on visit, tourist or student visas needn’t get the certificate either. A Dubai Police official stated that if an expatriate comes to the UAE as a new employee, “he/she will have to get a good conduct certificate from his/her home country before the visa can be issued”. However, the official clarified that the certificate is not mandatory if an existing resident is switching jobs within the country. “But it’s up to the employer if they still want a certificate of good conduct issued by the local police from the employee.” SHARE",english

Kerala edged West Bengal 4-2 in a dramatic penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw at the end of extra-time to lift the 72nd Santosh Trophy at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata on Sunday. 
Kerala, which had already beaten West Bengal in the group stage of the tournament, started the brighter of the two sides and vaulted into the lead in the 19th minute with a goal from MS Jithin. 
However, West Bengal captain Jiten Murmu equalized in the 66th minute to take the game into extra time. 
Vibin Thomas scored a 117th minute goal to put Kerala in the lead once again but the team was unable to see out the game as Tirthankar Sarkar scored from a freekick with virtually the last kick of the game to force a penalty shootout to decide the final. 
The last time these two teams met each other in the final (1993-94), West Bengal had won 5-3 on penalties after a 2-2 stalemate after extra time, however this time around there was to be no repeat of that as Kerala held its nerve in the shootout with Seesan S stroking in the winning penalty to clinch a memorable victory for his team. 
The win saw Kerala lift the trophy for the sixth time. 
Both teams had numerous opportunities to score but wasteful finishing meant that the game went into extra time. The game swung Kerala’s way when West Bengal were reduced to ten men in the 111th minute after Rajon Barman was dismissed for a high boot. 
After Vibin Thomas restored Kerala’s lead, it appeared that the team would hold on to win the trophy in extra time until Tirthankar Sarkar stepped up to stroke home a 126th minute freekick. 
Kerala earlier beat Mizoram in the semifinal while West Bengal defeated Karnataka to set up the summit clash. It was the first time since 2004-05 that Kerala had reached the final. 
Kerala’s win also denied West Bengal a record 33rd Santosh Trophy title. 
CM Pinarayi Vijayan congratulated the Kerala Football team on winning the 72nd edition of Santosh Trophy. This is the 6th title win for the State. He also congratulated the West Bengal team who put up a great fight to create a thriller of a game. #KERvBEN pic.twitter.com/O1SOoUbfJr — CMO Kerala (@CMOKerala) April 1, 2018

By: M Sarita Varma | New Delhi | Published: April 2, 2018 3:17 AM Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurates Kerala Global Digital Summit #FUTURE in Kochi on Thursday. 
Decks are clear for Kerala to emerge as India’s first state with the largest public Wi-Fi network providing statewide access. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan affirmed at the recent #Future2018 event that his government would soon roll out connectivity through 1,000 free public Wi-Fi hotspots with tech handholding from Cisco. 
The state-wide network will provide citizens access to the internet with Wi-Fi spots deployed in parks, libraries and other public spaces. Cisco has been teaming up with the Kerala government over the last months, setting up end-to-end Wi-Fi hardware for these wireless access points. “This sets an example that other Indian states can replicate,” says Sudhir Nayar, managing director, Commercial Sales, Cisco (India and SAARC). “The vision will help harness the power of digital transformation to accelerate economic and social growth in the state,” he says. 
The central government has plans to set up public Wi-Fi hotspots across the country under the BharatNet project. The Telangana government and a few other state governments are also mulling to set up Wi-Fi hotspots, so that the public can enjoy free broadband, even while travelling. 
For Kerala, its first global digital summit #Future2018 is intended to project that “the 35-million consumption-ready population of the state is ready as a global information and digital technology destination,” according to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, refering to the latest string of knowledge destination initiatives such as Knowledge City in Thiruvananthapuram, Maker Village in Kochi and Mobility Hub in Kozhikode. “We target to increase the floor area of IT parks in Kerala by 10 million sq ft,” he says. 
More recently, Kerala Technopark is also on the radar of Japanese auto giant Nissan ’s global digital hub project. 
“Meets like #Future2018 is planned once in two years, to have continous engagement with best brains like Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella, head of artificial intelligence unit Joseph Sirosh, former RBI governor Raghuaram Rajan, Infosys co-founders Nandan Nilekani and Kris Gopalakrishnan and also Harvard University professor Gita Gopinath,” SD Shibulal, chairman of the High Power IT Council (HPIC), Kerala, told FE. HPIC has also mooted a network of 150 digital achievers. The Kerala government had started its IT initiatives with a digital literacy programme in 2015, that trained in basics like internet, email, social media and use of tablet computers. This training was backed by Tata Consultancy Services. What helped was that the state has a long time lead in literacy and education. 
“Digitally empowering the citizens is a key goal, after the state’s digital literacy programme,” says M Shiva Shankar, secretary (IT), Kerala. “For this, we are rolling out projects such as K-Fon (Kerala Fibre Optic Network) and giving free internet connectivity to 20 lakh BPL (below poverty line) families”. The K-Fon project is estimated to cost `1,000 crore and will take at least 10 years to reach break-even.

Because of her determination to make the tribal pockets of Kerala open defecation free, Sectional forest officer PG Sudha was awarded by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in 2016. by Lekshmi Priya S April 2, 2018, 9:05 am 
U nlike people living in urban, rurban and even rural areas of the country, sensitising isolated tribal communities about the importance and need of proper sanitary facilities can be more or less equated to an overhaul of norms and practices that have been handed down from generation to generation. 
To think of it, those who have been living isolated and unacquainted with the ways of modern living would naturally find any new mannerism preposterous—for example, eating food with spoon or fork. 
In that case, wouldn’t it be very complicated to convince Adivasis to stop defecating in the open and build a toilet in their settlements? 
However, sectional forest officer PG Sudha did it and managed to singlehandedly supervise and facilitate the building of not one or two but 497 toilets across nine tribal colonies in Kuttampuzha Range in Kerala’s Ernakulam district and that too within a record time of three months. Having joined the state forest department 16 years ago, Sudha herself hails from one of the tribal communities in Kuttampuzha who have more or less adapted to modern culture and lifestyle in comparison to their isolated brethren in the deep woods.

The daring woman was conferred the Best Forest Guard Award by Kerala Chief Minister in 2006, for her exemplary services to the state forest department. 
In 2016, when every district in Kerala was working towards making the state Open Defecation Free (ODF), K Mohammed Y Safirull, the district collector of Ernakulam, had a brainwave. 
With the belief that Sudha’s deep-rooted knowledge about her roots could make her more suitable to approach the tribals, he entrusted the sole responsibility of the task, to the 51-year-old forest officer. 
“It wasn’t an easy task at all. In fact, every contractor I approached for the project had point blank refused to take the responsibility, as it was logistically hard to take materials and manpower to such remote forested regions. These are areas that had no connectivity whatsoever, and the closest settlement takes a minimum of 3 hours to reach by foot. Also, they were quoting prices that were multiple times higher than usual charges. Finally, I came up with the idea of involving local masons from the tribal settlements, which finally worked to our benefit,” says Sudha to The Better India . 
That was probably the easiest part. There was still the need to involve at least some experienced workers.

“I had to go all the way to Ernakulam city and quite literally had to beg people to come on board. The remaining workforce had been people from the department as I realised we knew better of the region and the tribal communities,” she remembers of the herculean task. 
Now that a workforce had been established, the logistical aspect of carrying all the construction materials through extremely dense forests full of wild elephants was a significant obstacle. The connectivity problem remained for Sudha and her team as well. Rivers and streams are indispensable facets of any forested region, and they worked out a plan to use the waterways to their advantage. Navigating through the waterways. Source: Facebook . 
“With the help of rafts, we managed to navigate all the materials to the designated locations near the tribal colonies. Since there aren’t proper roads or even a pathway in these regions, we had to move all the workers in jeeps. The monetary requirements of the project were mobilised through Panchayat funds. Because I could figure out an economical alternative for every step, the overall expenses fell quite well within the allocated budget, and we managed to accomplish what I had envisioned way ahead of time,” Sudha proudly mentions.

Sudha and other forest officials also took a personal interest in raising awareness about the perils of open defecation alongside the necessity for healthy sanitation, to the tribal communities, who were receptive and quite involved in the process. 
In fact, it has almost been two years since the toilets were set up and Sudha explains that the Adivasis have maintained it very well. 
Because of her determination to make the tribal pockets of Kerala open defecation free, Sudha received yet another award from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan during the ODF declaration event on November 1, 2016, followed by Nari Shakti Puraskar from the then President Pranab Mukherjee. Sudha has three sons, of which one works with the forest department, one is a police personnel and one works as a driver. One of the toilets built by Sudha. Source: Facebook . 
In a time when women still face gender disparity in workplaces and professional spheres, sectional forest officer PG Sudha has steadfastly proved that there is no job which is only a man’s forte and if one is willing to go the extra mile, anything can be achieved.

Decks are clear for Kerala to emerge as India’s first state with the largest public Wi-Fi network providing statewide access. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan affirmed at the recent #Future2018 event that his government would soon roll out connectivity through 1,000 free public Wi-Fi hotspots with technology handholding from Cisco. 
The state-wide network will provide citizens access to the internet with Wi-Fi spots deployed in parks, libraries and other public spaces. Cisco has been teaming up with the Kerala government over the last months, setting up end-to-end Wi-Fi hardware for these wireless access points. 
“This sets an example that other Indian states can replicate. The vision will help harness the power of digital transformation to accelerate economic and social growth in the state,” said Sudhir Nayar, Managing Director, Commercial Sales, Cisco (India and SAARC). 
The central government has plans to set up public Wi-Fi hotspots across the country under the BharatNet project. The Telangana government and a few other state governments are also mulling to set up Wi-Fi hotspots. 
For Kerala, its first global digital summit #Future2018 is intended to project that the 35-million consumption-ready population of the state is ready as a global information and digital technology destination, according to Vijayan, refering to the latest string of knowledge destination initiatives such as Knowledge City in Thiruvananthapuram, Maker Village in Kochi and Mobility Hub in Kozhikode. “We target to increase the floor area of IT parks in Kerala by 10 million sq ft,” he said. 
More recently, Kerala Technopark is also on the radar of Japanese auto giant Nissan’s global digital hub project. “Meets like #Future2018 is planned once in two years, to have continous engagement with best brains like Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, head of artificial intelligence unit Joseph Sirosh, former RBI governor Raghuaram Rajan, Infosys co-founders Nandan Nilekani and Kris Gopalakrishnan and also Harvard University professor Gita Gopinath,” SD Shibulal, chairman of the High Power IT Council (HPIC), Kerala said.

KOCHI (Kerala – India): The Kerala godman whose penis was allegedly chopped off by a 23-year-old woman who had accused him of rape got his genitals back through surgery. After changing his statement twice, the self-styled godman – Hari Swami, now claims that some “bigwigs are working against him” who were behind his penis chopping. 
“While I claimed then that I myself did it so as to get away from further trouble, the truth is that the same people whom I helped were behind this act and more than one person did it,” he said. 
The 55-year-old, whose genitals were slashed with a knife, said he had been in a lot of pain and had even considered getting his penis removed completely. “I was finally able to urinate freely,” he said. Hari Swami’s genitals were slashed with a knife last year in May allegedly by a 23-year-old woman. – (File Photo) 
In May last year, the 23-year-old woman had in her complaint said that the self-styled godman had been raping her for years and to end her ordeal she had chopped of the godman’s genitals. Hari Swami had later said that he himself had committed the act. 
The girl has told the police that the swami would come to their home to meet her mother and whenever he got the opportunity, he would allegedly rape her. 
The incident had taken place at the godman’s residence when he had tried to force himself on the woman, who had then chopped off his genitals before running out of the house, according to the police. She had then called the cops, who later said that Hari Swami had been abusing the woman for the past six years. 
The godman had been rushed to the hospital for a plastic surgery to get his penis fixed. However, due to the severe condition, the surgery could not have been performed with immediate results. 
Following the incident, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had praised the woman calling it “a courageous and strong act by the woman”.",english

Thiruvananthapuram : Archbishop M.Susaipakiam of Trivandrum on Saturday slammed the the state’s Pinarayi Vijayan government for not doing a proper rehabilitation programme in wake of Cyclone Ockhi, while complimenting the Tamil Nadu government for rising to the occasion. 
Addressing reporters here, Archbishop M.Susaipakiam of Trivandrum said they were told that the political leadership is busy with their party Congress and other things. 
“While the total dead in Kerala on account of Ockhi was 146, the compensation has been handed over to just 49. But in Tamil Nadu, the compensation has been given to 146 dead,” he said. 
The Church leadership also demanded that a social audit should be conducted in the way the funds for Ockhi relief and rehabilitation have been spent. 
Even as the Church says that the total dead is 146, according to the Kerala government figures, 52 people were killed and 91 remain missing. 
Cyclone Ockhi struck Kerala’s southern districts on November 30 last year and the worst affected were two fishing villages in the state capital and a huge majority of the affected belonged to the Latin archdiocese. 
The Church leadership also pointed out that they have so far spend Rs 14 lakh for medical relief to the affected, besides they have held numerous counselling sessions in the coastal hamlets and that also has cost them a good sum of money, Business Standard reported. 
The Kerala government had informed the ongoing assembly session that the process of giving compensation to the families of the missing was underway and it would be done once the formalities are over. 
It had, in January, announced that while the compensation to the families of the dead would be given Rs 2 million each and the same amount would be given to the families of the fishermen who have gone missing, but only after verification. 
It had then started giving a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000 each to the families of the missing fishermen. Have Something to Say? Comment on Facebook Share it with Friends:",english

The temple town of Chengannur will soon have a self-contained transit camp (edathavalom) for Sabarimala pilgrims. 
The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and the Devaswom Revenue Department will construct the camp at an estimate of ₹9.62 crore in collaboration with Bharat Petroleum Company Limited (BPCL). Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran and Devaswom Principal Secretary K.R. Jyotilal said the venture was part of a chain of transit camps planned by the government. 
Mr. Surendran said the proposal was to set up self-contained modern transit camps for Sabarimala pilgrims at select temple towns along National Highways and State Highways from Kasaragod to Kanyakumari. 
The idea was mooted by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at an official review meeting at Sabarimala. TDB president A.Padmakumar told The Hindu that the work on the transit camp at Chengannur would begin soon. 
The TDB and the government had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the BPCL for constructing the camp. The BPCL would construct the camp on the 1.63-acre TDB land near the Chengannur Mahadevar temple. In return, the State would provide space to the BPCL for running its retail fuel outlet at the camp, he said. The amenities planned at the facility included ‘viris’ (pilgrim shelters) with Wi-Fi, guest rooms, vegetarian restaurant, laundry area, prepaid counters for booking puja and prasadom, annadanam hall, parking lots, air-conditioned dining hall, and a pond. 
Mr. Padmakumar said the camp would have a solar power plant and a biogas plant, making it a sustainable development model. 
The facility would be exclusively for pilgrims during 160 days a year when the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple would be open while it could be shared for community interactions such as marriages, strictly in conformity with temple customs, during the remaining 205 days. 
37 transit camps 
The Minister said the government had prepared an action plan to set up 37 such transit camps at select locations in the State. 
The Chennai-based Pithavadian and Partners had prepared project reports for 18 such camps, estimated to cost ₹225 crore. The projects would be implemented in collaboration with the Indian Oil Corporation, BPCL, and similar public sector companies. 
The government too had sanctioned ₹100 crore for the project, he said.",english

Representational image Thiruvananthapuram: In a big relief to thousands of the UAE job seekers from Kerala as well as the rest of India, the Gulf nation has put on hold its decision mandating Good Conduct Certificate / Police Clearance Certificate for job visas. The Consulate General of India in Dubai confirmed this on Twitter on Sunday. ""It is confirmed that we have received communication from Government of UAE, that good conduct certificate for employment visas is temporarily suspended,"" said the tweet by its handle 'India in Dubai'. The official Twitter account of UAE's Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation and Official page of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation had also confirmed this to those who made queries. “Kindly note that the good conduct certificate is postponed from the first of April till further notice,"" tweeted MOHRE_UAE. DC had highlighted the plight of the candidates in getting the PCC, especially the fee of around Rs 6,000 charged for various attestations of the PCC as well as the involvement of some private agencies. Some candidates had even alleged that some officials of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram had been diverting them to a nearby private agency for PCC related attestation services. The UAE consulate had not responded to e-mail queries of DC on the matter. Apart from the hefty fees for attestations of the PCC, Kerala Police also fished in troubled waters by introducing another Rs 1,000 for issuing PCC, which they cut by half following widespread protests. The police earned about Rs 2 crore on this account over the last two months. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had informed the Assembly in written reply recently that in February alone, 23,410 candidates had applied for PCC at various police stations in the state. The fee from these candidates alone came to around Rs 1.2 crore. The UAE had made Good Conduct Certificate mandatory for job visas from February 4. While many foreign countries, including Kuwait, a GCC member country, has been accepting the PCC issued by the ministry of external affairs through regional passport offices, the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram had taken up the matter with the state police and the police offered to issue PCC through police stations. It had to be further attested by the state home department and the MoEA before being certified by the consulate. But the PCCs issued by the police stations lacked a uniform pattern, and hence many were even rejected by the consulate. An UAE-based lawyer, Femin Panikkassery, had recently approached the High Court citing that the UAE authorities had rejected PCCs issued by regional passport offices and the HC also sought a clarification from the Centre last week.

2002ൽ വേമ്പനാട്ടുകായലിൽ സംഭവിച്ച കുമരകം ബോട്ട്ദുരന്തത്തിനുശേഷമാണ് ജീവൻരക്ഷാബോട്ടുകളുടെ ആവശ്യകത ജലഗതാഗതവകുപ്പിന് ബോധ്യപ്പെട്ടത്. അന്നത്തെ അപകടത്തിൽ 29 പേരാണ് മുങ്ങിമരിച്ചത്. നടുക്കായലിലുണ്ടായ അപകടത്തിൽ രക്ഷാപ്രവർത്തനം വൈകിയതും മരണസംഖ്യ വർധിക്കാനിടയാക്കി. സർവീസ് ബോട്ടുകൾ യാത്രയവസാനിപ്പിച്ച് രാത്രിയിൽ സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ കെട്ടിയിടുമ്പോൾ രോഗികളെ ആശുപത്രിയിലെത്തിക്കാൻ സഹായം ചോദിച്ച് ആളുകൾ വരാറുണ്ടെന്ന് ജലഗതാഗതവകുപ്പ് ഡയറക്ടർ ഷാജി വി നായർ പറഞ്ഞു. മാനുഷിക പരിഗണനയിൽ രോഗികളെ ആശുപത്രിയിലെത്തിക്കാൻ ബോട്ട് ഓടിക്കാറുണ്ടെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞു. ഇത്തരം സാഹചര്യങ്ങൾ കണക്കുകൂട്ടിയാണ് ജീവൻരക്ഷാബോട്ടുകൾ ഇറക്കാനുള്ള വകുപ്പിന്റെ തീരുമാനം. ബോട്ട് ഉപയോഗപ്പെടുത്തുന്നവരിൽനിന്ന് ചെറിയതുകമാത്രം ഈടാക്കും. 
സർക്കാരിന്റെ പിന്തുണയിൽ ആധുനീകരണത്തിലേക്ക് കുതിക്കുന്ന ജലഗതാഗതവകുപ്പ് കാലപ്പഴക്കംചെന്ന ബോട്ടുകൾ പിൻവലിച്ച് പുതിയ 14 ബോട്ടുകൾ ഇറക്കാനും തീരുമാനിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഘട്ടംഘട്ടമായി സോളാർബോട്ടുകളിലേക്ക് മാറുകയാണ് ലക്ഷ്യം. ടൂറിസം കേന്ദ്രങ്ങളെ ബന്ധിപ്പിച്ച് എസി ബോട്ടുകൾ ഓടിക്കാനും പദ്ധതിയുണ്ട്. വരുമാനം വർധിപ്പിക്കുന്നതിന്റെ ഭാഗമായി വാട്ടർ ടാക്സിയാണ് മറ്റൊന്ന്. ആലപ്പുഴ, എറണാകുളം, കോട്ടയം, കൊല്ലം, കണ്ണൂർ, കാസർകോട് ജില്ലകളിലായി 55 ബോട്ടുകളാണ് നിലവിലുള്ള സർവീസ്. ദിവസേന 65,000 യാത്രക്കാരുമുണ്ട്.

KOCHI: The Kerala High Court rejected pleas by CPI-M leader P. Jayarajan and five others seeking the quashing of Unlawful Activities Prevention act (UAPA) slapped on them in the Kathiroor Manoj murder case. 
A close associate of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Jayarajan appealed before the division bench after a single bench rejected his earlier plea. 
In their petition, Jayarajan and others said the UAPA was slapped without the approval of the State Government. 
The CBI had filed charge sheet in September last against Jayarajan and other party workers in connection with the murder of Kathiroor Manoj. 
There are 25 accused in the case and Jayarajan is the 25th accused. RSS leader Manoj was waylaid and hacked to death on September 1, 2014 at Kathiroor in Kannur. 
The CBI had arrested Jayarajan in February 2016, but he got out on bail the very next month. The agency last year named Jayarajan as the ‘principal conspirator’ in Manoj’s murder. 
The charge sheet stated political vendetta to be the motive behind the murder.The CBI also mentioned that Jayarajan had political and personal vengeance against Manoj. Jayarajan was charged under Section 18 (punishment for conspiracy) of UAPA. ALSO READ",english

THE general council of CITU which met in Kozhikode from March 23-26, gave the clarion call to the working class of the country to participate in huge numbers in the rally in the national capital Delhi on September 5, to highlight its demands. The general council expressed its great happiness that the two major countrywide organisations of the peasants and agricultural workers, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) and the All India Agricultural Workers’ Union (AIAWU) agreed to join the rally. Thus for the first time largest section of the toiling people – industrial workers from the organised and unorganised sectors from the urban and rural areas, scheme workers and peasants and agricultural workers will jointly march in the national capital for the first time voicing their demands. 
349 members of the general council including 53 women from 22 states in the country attended the general council in addition to 14 invitees from the fraternal trade union organisations and 12 special invitees from different states. 
The CITU general council meeting started with hoisting of the CITU flag in the morning on March 23 by Hemalata, president of CITU. Floral tributes were paid at the martyrs’ column by Hemalata and Tapan Sen, general secretary of CITU, followed by all the office bearers and general council members. The photo of Bhagat Singh, who was martyred along with his comrades-in-arms Sukh Dev and Rajguru, on the same day in 1931, was garlanded by Tapan Sen, Hemalata and others. 
Elamaram Kareem, national secretary of CITU and chairman of the reception committee welcomed the general council members to the historical city of Kozhikode, which had the great legacy of anti-colonial and working class struggles. The city was a hub of activity of legendary leaders like P Krishna Pillai, EMS Namboodiripad and AK Gopalan. The reception committee organised a series of programmes including seminars on various subjects, family get together, general body meetings etc on the occasion of the CITU general council meeting in the city. The expenditure for the meeting was met exclusively with the contributions from the members of CITU in the district. 
Hemalata presided over the meeting. In the inaugural session, the general council unanimously passed two important resolutions – one condemning the barbaric attacks including burning and vandalising of offices, physical attacks, extortion, forceful occupying of offices of CITU and other Left oriented organisations by the BJP; attacks on the cadres and supporters of the Left parties and CITU in Tripura. It extended solidarity to the Left and CITU cadres and expressed hope that they will be able to create confidence among the people to resist these attacks soon. 
The general council also congratulated the working class of Kerala and all the 16 trade unions who have jointly decided to go on a state wide strike against the decision of the BJP led government at the centre to introduce Fixed Term Employment in all sectors through a notification, despite the strong opposition expressed by all the central trade unions to an earlier attempt towards this. It called upon all its state committees to hold demonstrations and rallies all over the country, in support of the joint strike in Kerala. 
The general council had a detailed discussion on the existing political and economic situation in the country and the conditions of the working class and other sections of the toiling people, on the basis of the report placed by Tapan Sen. It has decided to intensify independent and joint struggles, involve all sections of the working people in these struggles and expose the anti-worker, anti-people and anti-national character of the neoliberal policies and the political parties pursuing these policies despite strong resistance from the workers and others. The general council of CITU decided that neoliberalism, communalism and authoritarianism, the three major features of the BJP led Modi government have to be fought unitedly by the working class at the same time as they are interlinked. As part of these efforts, the general council called upon all its state committees to: Play an active role in the effective implementation of the call of the Jan Ekta Jan Adhikar Andolan (JEJAA) to hold demonstrations all over the country on May 23, on the eve of the BJP led Modi government completing its four years in office.

Resolution in Support of the Strike by Trade Unions in Kerala 
THIS general council of CITU, being held at Kozhikode, Kerala on March 23-26, congratulates the working people of Kerala and its leadership – the state units of central trade unions and state unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, UTUC, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, STU, HMPK, TUCI, AKTU, KTUC, KTUC(J), KTUC(M), INLC – for the bold and timely response they have shown by giving one day statewide strike on April 2, against the draconian notification of the government of India, replacing permanent employment with term based employment and extending the fixed term employment to all establishments, thereby enslaving the workers and throwing them to the mercy of the corporates, permanency of the job is thereby given a good bye. This move which is a part of the ongoing implementation of the neoliberal policies that caters to the needs of the big corporates, has to be fought tooth and nail and the decision of the working men and women of the Kerala state would necessarily enthuse the entire Indian people who are in militant struggle against the anti-people policies of the government of India. 
This general council calls upon all affiliates, other fraternal organisations and CITU state committees to organise protest demonstrations in solidarity with this strike action.",english

The Consulate General of India in Dubai confirmed this on Twitter on Sunday. ""It is confirmed that we have received communication from Government of UAE, that good conduct certificate for employment visas is temporarily suspended,"" said the tweet by its handle 'India in Dubai'.
The official Twitter account of UAE's Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation and Official page of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation had also confirmed this to those who made queries. “Kindly note that the good conduct certificate is postponed from the first of April till further notice,"" tweeted MOHRE_UAE. DC had highlighted the plight of the candidates in getting the PCC, especially the fee of around Rs 6,000 charged for various attestations of the PCC as well as the involvement of some private agencies.
Some candidates had even alleged that some officials of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram had been diverting them to a nearby private agency for PCC related attestation services. The UAE consulate had not responded to e-mail queries of DC on the matter. Apart from the hefty fees for attestations of the PCC, Kerala Police also fished in troubled waters by introducing another Rs 1,000 for issuing PCC, which they cut by half following widespread protests.
The police earned about Rs 2 crore on this account over the last two months. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had informed the Assembly in written reply recently that in February alone, 23,410 candidates had applied for PCC at various police stations in the state. The fee from these candidates alone came to around Rs 1.2 crore. The UAE had made Good Conduct Certificate mandatory for job visas from February 4. While many foreign countries, including Kuwait, a GCC member country, has been accepting the PCC issued by the ministry of external affairs through regional passport offices, the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram had taken up the matter with the state police and the police offered to issue PCC through police stations.
It had to be further attested by the state home department and the MoEA before being certified by the consulate. But the PCCs issued by the police stations lacked a uniform pattern, and hence many were even rejected by the consulate. An UAE-based lawyer, Femin Panikkassery, had recently approached the High Court citing that the UAE authorities had rejected PCCs issued by regional passport offices and the HC also sought a clarification from the Centre last week.",english

തളിപ്പറമ്പ്∙ ബംഗാളിൽ സിപിഎമ്മിന് അന്ത്യം കുറിച്ചത് നന്ദിഗ്രാമിലെ പോരാട്ടമാണെങ്കിൽ കേരളത്തിൽ സിപിഎമ്മിന്റെ അന്ത്യശ്വാസം മുഴങ്ങുന്നത് കീഴാറ്റൂരിലാണെന്നു ബിജെപി അഖിലേന്ത്യാ സെക്രട്ടറി രാഹുൽ സിൻഹ. കീഴാറ്റൂർ വയലിലെ ഒരു തരി മണ്ണ് പോലും അഴിമതിക്കാർക്കു വിട്ടു കൊടുക്കാൻ ബിജെപി അനുവദിക്കില്ലെന്നും കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ കർഷകർ നടത്തുന്ന സമരത്തിനു ബിജെപി എല്ലാവിധ പിന്തുണയും നൽകുമെന്നും നന്ദ്രിഗ്രാം സമര നായകൻ കൂടിയായ രാഹുൽ സിൻഹ പറഞ്ഞു. ബിജെപിയുടെ നേതൃത്വത്തിൽ കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽനിന്ന് കണ്ണൂരിലേക്കു നടത്തുന്ന കർഷക രക്ഷാ മാർച്ച് കീഴാറ്റൂർ വയലിൽ ഉദ്ഘാടനം ചെയ്യുകയായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം. 
കർഷകരെ കൊന്നൊടുക്കി ഭൂമി തട്ടിയെടുക്കാനാണു സിപിഎം ശ്രമിക്കുന്നത്. പിറന്ന മണ്ണിനു വേണ്ടിയുള്ള പോരാട്ടമാണു കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ നടക്കുന്നത്. വയൽ മണ്ണിട്ടു നികത്തുകയും ഇവിടെ നിന്നുള്ള മണ്ണ് കോരി കടത്തുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നതിലൂടെ മുന്നൂറ് കോടി രൂപയുടെ വരെ അഴിമതിക്കാണു സിപിഎം ലക്ഷ്യമിടുന്നത്. ഇതിനെതിരെ ബിജെപി രംഗത്തു വന്നതോടെയാണ് കോൺഗ്രസ് ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ള കക്ഷികളും മുന്നോട്ടു വന്നത്. എന്നാൽ അവർ സമരം പാതി വഴിയിൽ ഉപേക്ഷിക്കും. ലക്ഷ്യം നേടുന്നത് വരെ ബിജെപി സമരക്കാരായ കർഷകർക്കൊപ്പമുണ്ടായിരിക്കുമെന്നും സിൻഹ പറഞ്ഞു. ബിജെപിയുടെ കർഷകരക്ഷാ മാർച്ചിൽനിന്ന്. 
മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ ഈ കർഷക വേട്ട അവസാനിപ്പിക്കണം. ബിജെപി നടത്തുന്ന ജാഥയെ ഭയന്നാണ് സിപിഎം ജില്ലയിൽ ജാഥകൾ നടത്തുന്നത്. അതിന്റെ പേര് കർഷകരോടുള്ള മാപ്പപേക്ഷ ജാഥ എന്നാക്കി മാറ്റണമെന്നും രാഹുൽ സിൻഹ ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടു. തുടർന്ന് ജാഥാ ക്യാപ്റ്റൻ പി.കെ.കൃഷ്ണദാസിന് രാഹുൽ സിൻഹ പതാക കൈമാറി ജാഥ ഫ്ലാഗ് ഓഫ് ചെയ്തു. കീഴാറ്റൂർ സമര നായിക നമ്പ്രാടത്ത് ജാനകി രാഹുൽ സിൻഹക്ക് പാളതൊപ്പിയും കതിർകറ്റയും നൽകി. സമര നായകൻ സുരേഷ് കീഴാറ്റൂർ സത്യപ്രതിജ്ഞ ചൊല്ലിക്കൊടുത്തു. രാഹുൽ സിൻഹ കൊണ്ടു വന്ന നന്ദിഗ്രാമിലെ മണ്ണ് നമ്പ്രാടത്ത് ജാനകിയും രാഹുൽ സിൻഹയും ചേർന്ന് കീഴാറ്റൂർ വയലിൽ നിക്ഷേപിച്ചു. ബിജെപി കോഴിക്കോട് മേഖല വൈസ് പ്രസിഡന്റ് എ.പി.ഗംഗാധരൻ അധ്യക്ഷത വഹിച്ചു. ജാഥ വൈകിട്ട് കണ്ണൂരിൽ സമാപിക്കും. × Advertisement related stories",malayalam

തിരുവനന്തപുരം: കാഞ്ഞങ്ങാട് നെഹ്റു കോളേജ് അധ്യാപികയെ അപമാനിച്ച സംഭവത്തിൽ പ്രകരണവുമായി മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ. കാഞ്ഞങ്ങാട് നെഹ്റു കോളേജ് പ്രിന്‍സിപ്പലിന് യാത്രയപ്പ് ദിവസം ആദരാഞ്ജലി നല്‍കി അപമാനിച്ച സംഭവം വൻ വിവാദമായിരുന്നു. ഇതിന് പിന്നിൽ എസ്എഫ്ഐ ആണെന്ന് അധ്യാപിക ആരോപിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തിരുന്നു. ഇക്കാര്യം എസ്എഫ്ഐ നിഷേധിച്ചിരുന്നു. 
പ്രതിപക്ഷ നേതാവ് രമേശ് ചെന്നിത്തലയുടെ സബ്മിഷന് വിദ്യാഭ്യാസമന്ത്രി സി രവീന്ദ്രനാഥ് മറുപടി പറഞ്ഞതിനു ശേഷമാണ് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി നിയമസഭയിൽ അധ്യാപികയെ അപമാനിച്ച വിഷയത്തിൽ പ്രതികരണം നടത്തിയത്. അധ്യാപികയെ അപമാനിക്കുന്നത് ആരും അംഗീകരിച്ചിട്ടില്ല. ഇത്തരത്തിലുള്ള നടപടി അംഗീകരിക്കുന്ന സംഘടനയല്ല എസ്എഫ്ഐയെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞു.കാഞ്ഞങ്ങാട് നെഹ്‌റു കോളേജില്‍ പ്രിന്‍സിപ്പല്‍ പിവി പുഷ്പജയ്ക്ക് ആദരാഞ്ജലി അര്‍പ്പിച്ച സംഭവത്തില്‍ വിദ്യാര്‍ത്ഥികള്‍ക്കെതിരെ കോളേജ് മാനേജ്‌മെന്റ് നടപടി ആരംഭിച്ചിരുന്നു.

അതേസമയം സംഭവത്തില്‍ എസ്എഫ്‌ഐക്കെതിരെ പ്രതിഷേധം ശക്തമായി കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയാണ്. മറ്റ് വിദ്യാര്‍ത്ഥി സംഘടനകളും കോളേജിലെ വിദ്യാര്‍ത്ഥികളും എസ്എഫ്‌ഐ ചെയ്തത് തെറ്റാണെന്ന് പരസ്യമായി പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇതോടെ സംഘടനയുടെ ജില്ലാ നേതൃത്വവും സംസ്ഥാന നേതൃത്വവും വെട്ടിലായിരിക്കുകയാണ്. എന്നാല്‍ കുറ്റക്കാര്‍ക്കെതിരെ ഇതുവരെ ശക്തമായ നിലപാടെടുക്കാന്‍ എസ്എഫ്‌ഐ തയ്യാറായിട്ടില്ല.

The CPI-M (Communist Party of India-Marxist) and the CPI (Communist Party of India) are premier allies in the ruling Left government. Vijayan told the state Assembly: ""This government will in no way tolerate corruption. In this particular case, the government has done no wrong. ""The visuals aired show a government official playing truant and the Revenue Minister has already announced the steps taken. We now announce a vigilance probe into it."" Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan is a CPI leader. The expose shows an Asianet TV channel team posing as a group of businessmen looking for a particular piece of land in the district to build a resort. They first approach Kunju Mohammed, a real estate broker, who takes them to Wayanad Deputy Collector T. Somnathan and some CPI district leaders, including its Wayanad unit secretary Vijayan Cherukara. Mohammed connects them with Somnathan and Cherukara, and the latter using his influence gets access to the state secretariat. The visuals -- besides the audio of the conversation between Mohammed, Somnathan and Cherukara -- try to establish that there is an unholy alliance between them to allegedly usurp the government land. Senior Congress legislator V.D. Sateeshan said the sting shows what ""we see in films -- how officials manipulate land records to favour people who are willing to bribe them"". ""This is the latest example of how attempts to usurp government land is being carried out by the mafia, which operates not just in Wayanad but across the state."" Chandrasekheran, however, denied all charges and said since he took over as Minister, the government has registered 602 cases against various people who tried to usurp government land. ""Is it not common practice for people to come to party offices to get justice. I did receive an application from six people in this case and as is the norm, I asked the Wayanad District Collector to look into the matter. ""What you all should see is no favours were given and in fact we have already suspended the Deputy Collector and all the files regarding this have been confiscated and the probe has begun,"" said Chandrasekheran. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Minister was trying to trivialise the issue. ""Please do not forget that the four CPI ministers in the cabinet even went to the extent of boycotting the weekly cabinet meeting last year when the Chief Minister was trying to shield a Minister (Thomas Chandy) in an alleged land usurpment. ""The CPI-M appears to be the happiest after this case surfaced,"" said Chennithala.",english

കണ്ണൂർ: പിണറായി സർക്കാരിനെയും സിപിഎമ്മിനെയും മുൾമുനയിൽ നിർത്തിയ സമരമായിരുന്നു കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ വയൽക്കിളികളുടെ സമരം. തളിപ്പറമ്പിൽ വയൽ നികത്തി ബൈപ്പാസ് റോഡ് വരുന്നതിനെതിരെയാണ് വയൽക്കിളികൾ സമരം നടത്തുന്നത്. രണ്ടാം ഘട്ട സമരമാണ് ഇപ്പോൾ നടക്കുന്നത്. സമരത്തിന് പൂർണ്ണ പിന്തുണയുമായി ഇപ്പോൾ ബിജെപി എത്തിയിരിക്കുകയാണ്. 
കീഴാറ്റൂരില്‍ വയല്‍ നികത്തിയുള്ള ബൈപാസ് നിര്‍മാണം ഉപേക്ഷിക്കാന്‍ സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ തയാറാവണമെന്നാവശ്യപ്പെട്ട് കീഴാറ്റൂരില്‍ നിന്നും കണ്ണൂരിലേക്ക് ഇന്ന് ബിജെപി മാര്‍ച്ച്. വയല്‍ക്കിളികള്‍ക്ക് ഐക്യദാര്‍ഢ്യം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചാണ് ബിജെപി സംഘടിപ്പിക്കുന്ന കര്‍ഷക രക്ഷാ മാര്‍ച്ച് നടക്കുന്നത്. പികെ കൃഷ്ണദാസാണ് മാർച്ച് നയിക്കുന്നത്. ബിജെപി ദേശീയ സെക്രട്ടറപി രാഹുൽ സിൻഹയാണ് മാർച്ച് ഉദ്ഘാടനം ചെയ്തത്. 'കീഴടങ്ങില്ല കീഴാറ്റൂർ' എന്ന മുദ്രാവാക്യമുയർത്തിയാണ് മാർച്ച്. ആയിരകണക്കിന് ബിജെപി പ്രവർത്തകർ 
മാർച്ചിൽ ആയിരക്കണക്കിന് ബിജെപി പ്രവർത്തകർ പങ്കെടുത്തു. കീഴാറ്റൂര്‍ വയലില്‍ റോഡ് നിര്‍മിക്കുന്നതുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടുള്ള എല്ലാ പ്രവര്‍ത്തനങ്ങളും സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ അവസാനിപ്പിക്കുക, മണ്ണിന് വേണ്ടി പോരാടുന്ന സമരക്കാരുമായി സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ ചര്‍ച്ച നടത്തുക, ജനപ്രതിനിധികളുമായി ചര്‍ച്ച നടത്താന്‍ തയാറാവുക, ബദല്‍ റോഡിനെ കുറിച്ചുള്ള ചര്‍ച്ചകള്‍ സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ നടത്തുക തുടങ്ങിയ ആവശ്യങ്ങളാണ് മാർച്ചിലൂടെ ബിജെപി ഉന്നയിക്കുന്നത്. ശോഭ സുരേന്ദ്രന്‍, എംടി രമേശ്, എഎന്‍ രാധാകൃഷ്ണന്‍, ചലച്ചിത്ര സംവിധായകന്‍ അലി അക്ബര്‍, നടി മേനകാ സുരേഷ് തുടങ്ങിയവര്‍ മാര്‍ച്ചില്‍ പങ്കെടുക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. വൈകിട്ട് ആറിന് കണ്ണൂരിൽ മാർച്ച് സമാപിക്കും. കേരളം കീഴാറ്റൂരിലേക്ക്... 
കേരളം കീഴാറ്റൂർ എന്ന മുദ്രാവാക‌്യമുയർത്തി തളിപ്പറമ്പിൽ നിന്നും കീഴാറ്റൂിലേക്ക് ഇതിന് മുമ്പ് മാർച്ച് നടന്നിരുന്നു. സിപിഎം ഒഴികെയുള്ള എല്ലാ പാർട്ടികളും ഈ മാർച്ചിന് പിന്തുണ പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് രംഗത്തെത്തിയിരുന്നു. കോൺഗ്രസ് നേതാവ് വിഎം സുധീരൻ, കെ സുധാകരൻ, പിസി ജോർജ്, എംപി സുരേഷ്ഗോപി തുടങ്ങിയവർ പങ്കെടുത്തിരുന്നു. അതിനുശേഷം ബിജെപി സമരം ഹൈജാക്ക് ചെയ്തെന്ന തരത്തിൽ വാർത്തകളും വന്നിരുന്നു. വയൽക്കിളികൾക്കിടയിൽ തന്നെ ഇത്തരത്തിൽ അഭിപ്രായ വ്യത്യാസം ഉടലെടുത്തിരുന്നു. ഈ മാർച്ചോടെയാണ് വയൽക്കിളികൾ രണ്ടാംഘട്ട സമരത്തിന് തുടക്കം കുറിച്ചത്. സിപിഎം കത്തിച്ച സമരപന്തൽ സമരസമിതി പുനഃസ്ഥാപിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തിരുന്നു. ലോങ് മാർച്ച് തിരുവനന്തപുരത്തേക്ക്... 
കേന്ദ്ര ഉപരിതല ഗതാഗത മന്ത്രിയുമായി ദില്ലിയിൽ നടത്തിയ കൂടിക്കാഴ്ചയിൽ വയൽക്കിളികൾ സന്തോഷിച്ചിരുന്നു. എന്നാൽ ഗഡ്ക്കരിയുമായി നടത്തിയ ചർച്ചയിൽ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി കീഴാറ്റൂർ പ്രശ്നം ചർച്ച ചെയ്തിരുന്നില്ല. സമരക്കാർ ഉന്നയിക്കുന്ന കാര്യങ്ങൾ സർക്കാർ ഗൗരവ പൂർവ്വം പരിഗണിക്കുന്നില്ലെങ്കിൽ തിരുവനന്തപുരത്തേക്ക് ലോങ് മാർച്ച് നടത്തുമെന്ന് വയൽക്കിളികളുടെ നേതാവ് സുരേഷ് കീഴാറ്റൂർ നേരത്തെ പറഞ്ഞിരുന്നു. കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ നിന്ന് തിരുവനന്തപുരത്തേക്ക് നടത്തുന്ന ലോങ് മാർച്ചിന്റെ വിശദാംശങ്ങൾ പിന്നീട് തീരുമാനിക്കുമെന്നായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞത്. ഇതിന് ശേഷമാണ് വയൽക്കിളികൾക്ക് ഐക്യദാർഢ്യവുമായി ബിജെപി കണ്ണൂരിലേക്ക് കർഷക മാർച്ച് സംഘടിപ്പിക്കുന്നത്. ഇനി ചർച്ചയ്ക്കില്ലെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) will probe the reported bid to convert government land into private land in Wayanad with the involvement of revenue officials and CPI leaders, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
Replying to a notice on an adjournment motion by V.D. Satheesan following a television channel expose about a land conversion bid involving CPI Wayanad district secretary Vijayan Cherukara and revenue officials, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the Assembly on Tuesday that the VACB would also probe the case in addition to the inquiry of the Land Revenue Commissioner. 
“Mr. Vijayan Cherukara has also said that he was ready to face any probe in this regard. The government would not brook graft and would take stringent action against the corrupt,” the Chief Minister said. 
Mr. Satheesan alleged that the CPI district leadership and the revenue officials first identified a ‘no man’s land’ adjacent to a private land and converted it using political and bureaucratic clout. 
He came down heavily on the CPI, which, he said, was claiming to be a corrective force and was involving in such corrupt practices. 
He reminded how CPI Ministers had abstained themselves from a Cabinet meeting in protest against the delay in taking action against former Transport Minister Thomas Chandy who had faced land grabbing charges. He accused the CPI State and district leadership of colluding with the corrupt for land conversion. 
Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan said stringent action had already been taken against the officials involved. 
There was a bid to create a smokescreen and tarnish the image of the Revenue Department, the CPI and the government, especially in the run-up to the Chengannur Assembly byelection, he said. 
Judicial probe sought 
Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala demanded a judicial probe into the issue and said the Cabinet had no collective responsibility. 
Kerala Congress (M) leader K.M. Mani and BJP legislator O. Rajagopal too demanded a judicial probe into the issue. 
Based on the government’s explanation, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan denied notice for the motion and the entire Opposition walked out in protest.",english

The CM also informed that 170 PHCs in the state will be converted to Family Health Centres with better facilities and adequate staff while inaugurating a seminar organised by KSHRC. Recalling the recent incidence in the state when a seriously injured patient was held upside down in a stretcher by ambulance staff, chief minister said the incidence underscores the need for training ambulance staff in patient care. It was a proud moment to know that Kerala has bagged the first place in health care sector according NITI Aayog with the rating at 76.55 percent, yet there are lapses in terms of high rate of accidental deaths in the state and lapses in medical treatment which needs to be checked. ""The primary health centres (PHCs) in the state will be improved ensuring better facilities and staff. The 170 PHCs in the state will be transformed to Family Health Centres (FHCs) with all facilities and creating 4800 new posts. FHCs will be equipped with adequate facilities and doctors to address the health issues of each family,"" he said. Based on complaints from patients against some private hospitals, KSHRC had directed to install CCTV cameras in ICUs at private hospitals to check lapses in treatment and it has to be examined. In case of patients with grievances over medical negligence, when they appeal to the Medical Board, the Board should take an unbiased stance instead of supporting the medical fraternity. The accused doctors can go for appeal again while the patient has no way to appeal to a higher authority. Upright civil servants who had made it to the service after their graduation in medicine should head such a Board and it should ensure justice to the affected patient to function in an unbiased manner for its credibility, he said. In case of mercy killing of terminally ill, though the Supreme Court has issued a favourable verdict, the Parliament has to ensure that its implementation is not misused and for that the government has to ensure a proper system in place, he said. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the nexus between corporate hospitals and drug mafia has left health care in the lurch. “Even now majority of the patients hold the doctor’s word sacred and when that trust is lost it will affect the entire health sector. Human rights violations in health care sector are hardly addressed in the state. Every human being irrespective of economic status should be offered the best health care and that is the right of every individual which needs to be ensured. Currently, the poor cannot afford the treatment at super speciality hospitals and that needs to change, he said. He also called to ensure that the Parliament Bill on Mercy Killing should be verified for its legal clauses to prevent misuse before its introduction. KSHRC acting chairperson and former judge Justice P Mohandas sad most of the complaints received from patients on HR violations is against the hospitals, doctors and police personnel. The HR violations in health care of tribal community is also a major lapse that needs to be addressed, he said.  ",english

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said a vigilance probe would be ordered into allegations of bid to transfer surplus government land to private parties by certain government officials in collusion with political leaders and middlemen in Wayanad district. 
Vijayan made the announcement in the assembly after the issue was raised by Congress-led UDF Opposition in the wake of the exposure of the alleged role of CPI leaders and Wayanad district Deputy Collector in the land deal, by a Malayalam TV channel. 
The CPI is the second largest partner in the CPI-M led LDF government. The government was committed to weed out corruption and it has the support of all service organisations, Vijayan said adding still there were some employees who had not shed their old habits (accepting bribe). 
Though no corruption has taken place at the government-level, as the issue has come up, a vigilance investigation would be ordered, Vijayan said. The state government had yesterday suspended Deputy Collector T Somanathan after visuals aired by the TV channel purportedly showed him accepting bribe. 
Rejecting the Opposition charges that there was a ‘nexus’ between party leaders and officials for the conversion of land to facilitate its sale to private parties, State Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan said a comprehensive departmental inquiry by land commissioner was also on. 
While asserting that no transfer of land had taken place, the Minister said any one found guilty would be punished. The sting operation carried out by the channel was a deliberate attempt to malign the CPI, the Revenue Department and the ruling LDF, Chandrasekharan alleged. However, he said the party would examine if any lapse had occurred at the party-level and would take suitable action. 
Meanwhile, the UDF opposition members and the lone BJP member staged a walkout demanding a judicial probe into the alleged nexus between land mafia and CPI leaders, as they were not satisfied with the government response on the issue. 
Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala charged the CPI with becoming a party that has ‘dealings’ with land mafia. Earlier, when the opposition UDF moved a notice for adjournment motion on the issue, the Speaker rejected it. 
The channel’s team had approached official and some CPI district leaders posing as businessman interested in buying land for constructing a resort at Kottarthara village in Wayanad district. In the clip aired on Monday, the real estate broker identified as one Kunju Mohammed is seen telling that Rs 20 lakhs must be paid as bribe to officials and political leaders for the purpose. 
The Deputy Collector is also seen explaining the various steps to be taken for the conversion of surplus land to be transferred to individuals. For all the latest India News , download Indian Express App More Related News ",english

(Photo: PTI3_30_2018_000065B)By Rohit Thayyil and G Sudhakar NairNew Delhi , Mar 30 (PTI) Aiming to improve the ease of doing business in Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the long-standing perception that the state was not very investor-friendly was slowly changing with a slew of measures being undertaken by the Left government. Vijayan, 74, who completes two years in office on May 25, said the Kerala government is making efforts for eliminating the unnecessary delay in granting approvals for various investment proposals. Seeking to rebrand ""God's own Country"" as a preferred investment destination, the CPI-M strongman said the top priority was to create an enabling ecosystem to provide timely clearances in an effective and transparent manner and to ensure that it is maintained. He said even though the state lacked sufficient land for attracting investments and setting up infrastructure, the government is trying to provide an appropriate working environment for various companies in the state. ""As part of Ease of Doing Business, we are rectifying certain complaints which came up. We want to create an investment friendly environment in the state. We are trying to eliminate the unnecessary delay in getting approvals,"" he said in an exclusive interview to PTI here. ""If a decision has not been taken on an application within the time-frame allotted for it, the application will be considered as approved,"" he said.Vijayan said his government had held discussions with major companies such as Nissan, Intel and Tech Mahindra for investments in the state, days after the first-ever Global Digital Summit in Kerala, #FUTURE conclave that was held in Kochi . Nissan, a Japanese automotive major, is mulling setting up a digital hub in Kerala. Acknowledging that there was always a perception of Kerala not being 'business-friendly"" which made investors wary of making huge investments in the state, Vijayan said this was ""slowly changing"". ""We have only Kerala to market. Other states have enough land that they even provide it free of cost but we don't have that much area. But we are trying to provide a good working atmosphere and all kinds of assistance from the government. This is what we are planning and we have held discussions with major companies like Nissan, Intel and many more.""There is no more a sense of hopelessness in the state,"" he said. Kerala, in the recent months, has been trying to woo investors by showcasing its single window clearance mechanism, educated human power and impressive human development indices.According to the statement on RBI's regional office available on the website of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Kerala and Lakshadweep received about Rs 1,100 crore FDI equity during the nine-month period from April 2017. Vijayan expressed confidence that with the proactive steps taken to improve the business environment in Kerala will improve its rating in ease of doing business vis-a-vis top ranked states in the country. Kerala is aiming to achieve a quantum jump in 'Ease of doing business' rankings from 21 to be among the top 10 by next year. According to state officials, as part of reforms, an Investment Promotion and Facilitation Cell has been constituted on behalf of the Kerala State Single Window Board and it will be responsible for the smoother interaction with applicants and issuing speedy approvals. The Single Window Board will have the power to issue composite clearances that will be binding on all departments and agencies. To allay the fears of investors, the chief minister also said that the notorious Gawking Wage or the 'nokkukooli', as it is known colloquially, will end from May 1.""All trade unions in the state have come out openly against 'nokkukooli'. We have decided to end this practice from May 1. Some miscreants may still create trouble, but we plan to deal with them with a strong hand. Police have been directed to take strict action against it,"" he said.'Nokkukooli' is an euphemism for extortion by organised labour unions in Kerala under which wages are paid to trade union activists for allowing common householders/ investors/builders to unload belongings/materials using machines or their own labour. On land issues coming in the way of investments, Vijayan said acquisition was necessary in the state to fulfil the greater public good, adding that the government understands the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. ""We are short of land as you know. We understand the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. However, it is necessary that we undertake such acquisitions to fulfil certain public needs.""We are ready to provide adequate compensation and rehabilitation considering the plight of those who have to give up their land. People have been cooperative in this regard. People understand that we are not troubling them but we are doing it as we are out of options,"" he said. Referring to the recent Global Digital Summit held in Kochi , the chief minister said his government was doing its best to develop the Information Technology(IT) sector in the state.""The IT industry organised such an event. Based on their suggestions, we have arranged a special wing at the CM's office which can stay in touch with various companies. It has been a huge success. Many prominent personalities participated and we expect a change,"" Vijayan said.

Vijayan, 74, who completes two years in office on May 25, said the Kerala government is making efforts for eliminating the unnecessary delay in granting approvals for various investment proposals. Seeking to rebrand ""God's own Country"" as a preferred investment destination, the CPI-M strongman said the top priority was to create an enabling ecosystem to provide timely clearances in an effective and transparent manner and to ensure that it is maintained. He said even though the state lacked sufficient land for attracting investments and setting up infrastructure, the government is trying to provide an appropriate working environment for various companies in the state. ""As part of Ease of Doing Business, we are rectifying certain complaints which came up. We want to create an investment friendly environment in the state. We are trying to eliminate the unnecessary delay in getting approvals,"" he said in an exclusive interview to PTI here. ""If a decision has not been taken on an application within the time-frame allotted for it, the application will be considered as approved,"" he said.Vijayan said his government had held discussions with major companies such as Nissan, Intel and Tech Mahindra for investments in the state, days after the first-ever Global Digital Summit in Kerala, #FUTURE conclave that was held in Kochi . Nissan, a Japanese automotive major, is mulling setting up a digital hub in Kerala. Acknowledging that there was always a perception of Kerala not being 'business-friendly"" which made investors wary of making huge investments in the state, Vijayan said this was ""slowly changing"". ""We have only Kerala to market. Other states have enough land that they even provide it free of cost but we don't have that much area. But we are trying to provide a good working atmosphere and all kinds of assistance from the government. This is what we are planning and we have held discussions with major companies like Nissan, Intel and many more.""There is no more a sense of hopelessness in the state,"" he said. Kerala, in the recent months, has been trying to woo investors by showcasing its single window clearance mechanism, educated human power and impressive human development indices.According to the statement on RBI's regional office available on the website of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Kerala and Lakshadweep received about Rs 1,100 crore FDI equity during the nine-month period from April 2017. Vijayan expressed confidence that with the proactive steps taken to improve the business environment in Kerala will improve its rating in ease of doing business vis-a-vis top ranked states in the country. Kerala is aiming to achieve a quantum jump in 'Ease of doing business' rankings from 21 to be among the top 10 by next year. According to state officials, as part of reforms, an Investment Promotion and Facilitation Cell has been constituted on behalf of the Kerala State Single Window Board and it will be responsible for the smoother interaction with applicants and issuing speedy approvals. The Single Window Board will have the power to issue composite clearances that will be binding on all departments and agencies. To allay the fears of investors, the chief minister also said that the notorious Gawking Wage or the 'nokkukooli', as it is known colloquially, will end from May 1.""All trade unions in the state have come out openly against 'nokkukooli'. We have decided to end this practice from May 1. Some miscreants may still create trouble, but we plan to deal with them with a strong hand. Police have been directed to take strict action against it,"" he said.'Nokkukooli' is an euphemism for extortion by organised labour unions in Kerala under which wages are paid to trade union activists for allowing common householders/ investors/builders to unload belongings/materials using machines or their own labour. On land issues coming in the way of investments, Vijayan said acquisition was necessary in the state to fulfil the greater public good, adding that the government understands the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. ""We are short of land as you know. We understand the concern that some people have when they lose the little bit of land they own. However, it is necessary that we undertake such acquisitions to fulfil certain public needs.""We are ready to provide adequate compensation and rehabilitation considering the plight of those who have to give up their land. People have been cooperative in this regard. People understand that we are not troubling them but we are doing it as we are out of options,"" he said. Referring to the recent Global Digital Summit held in Kochi , the chief minister said his government was doing its best to develop the Information Technology(IT) sector in the state.""The IT industry organised such an event. Based on their suggestions, we have arranged a special wing at the CM's office which can stay in touch with various companies. It has been a huge success. Many prominent personalities participated and we expect a change,"" Vijayan said.

The shock incident of a woman principal of a college in Kerala being given ‘homage’ by some students has caught the attention of the state government, which has announced strong action against those involved in the incident.
Members of the Students Federation of India at the Nehru Arts and Science College, Kanhangad had burst crackers last week to celebrate the retirement of their principal, P.V. Pushpaja. The principal had been in disagreement with many of the SFI activities during her tenure at the college.
The students further humiliated her by offering ‘homage’ to her, by putting up a poster which read, ‘Condolences to a teacher who had died in the hearts of students’.
The incident had drawn flak from various quarters, with social and political leaders condemning the students’ act.
‘Unacceptable’
Yesterday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the state assembly that strong action would be taken against the students who sought to malign the principal.
“It is not just a case of dishonouring a woman. Teachers should be seen a step higher than mothers. That is our culture”, the chief minister said, stating that the humiliation meted out to the principal was unacceptable. The chief minister said the SFI was not an organisation that would condone such activities. SFI is the student wing of the Communist Party of India Marxist.
Pushpaja had alleged that the SFI unit at the college had been behind the incident of paying ‘homage’ to her and putting up posters carrying derogatory comments against her.
Many organisations in the state including the association of higher secondary teachers had condemned the act of the SFI students. Last year, SFI students had set fire to the chair of the Maharaja’s College principal in Kochi, during a strike by the teachers’ union against the principal.",english

The government has turned down a plea of Adani Vizhinjam Ports Ltd (AVPL), the private multi-port operator entrusted to build the superstructure and operate the seaport, seeking extension by 16 months to commission Phase I of the country’s first International Multipurpose Deepwater Seaport project at Vizhinjam. 
The decision was conveyed by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to Karan Adani, CEO of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (APSEZ), who called on him at his office on Tuesday. The AVPL CEO cited problems over procurement of rocks for the construction of the critical portion of the breakwater and damages suffered to the breakwater and the dredgers due to the 7.2-m high waves that lashed during the November 30 Ockhi cyclone. 
The deadline of 1,000 days set by the Adani group to commission Phase I was December 4, 2019 although four years had been given in the pact signed with the State. 
The work had commenced on December 5, 2015. Official sources said the Chief Minister went by a report of Independent Engineer (STUP Consultants) who had submitted to the Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd (VISL) that the extension sought need not be given to the AVPL. 
Breakwater 
The Chief Minister asked Mr. Adani to expedite steps to complete work on the breakwater and dredging that had come to a halt. On pointing out the hurdles faced by them, Mr. Vijayan said all government clearances would be provided within one month for the AVPL to source granite from the identified quarries. 
At the meeting, Mr. Adani informed the Chief Minister that the APSEZ would provide ₹5 lakh each to the kith and kin of those who had died in the Ockhi cyclone. This is in addition to the ₹22 lakh already announced by the State and Union government to the kin of the deceased. 
As it is certain that the AVPL would miss the 1,000-day deadline and that the government would not give extension, the APSEZ will have to complete the Phase I of the project in August 2020. A spokesman of the AVPL said they would put in all efforts to complete the project. 
The CEO called on Minister for Ports Kadannapally Ramachandran and Chief Secretary Paul Antony and held discussions with them. Principal Secretary, Ports, Biswanath Sinha; Jayakumar, Managing Director and CEO, VISL; and CEO of the AVPL Rajesh Jha; were present during the talks.",english

It is not that the government is oblivious to the impact that the project could make, but it says it has no option but to leverage existing means to check the growing power crisis in Kerala, which partially depends on the private sector for electricity. Things are no different in other states either. While Kerala has attained almost 100 per cent electrical coverage, many parts of India still remain in the dark. For a large portion of the Indian population, electricity to this day remains a distant dream. Enter two siblings who want to make India’s energy crisis a thing of the past. The duo has developed a new solution they say will not even slightly impact the ecological balance. Avant Garde Innovations,  the startup founded by siblings Arun and Anoop George from Kerala, has come up with a low-cost wind turbine that can generate enough electricity to power an entire house for a lifetime. The size of a ceiling fan, this wind turbine can generate 5 kWh/kW per day — with just a one-time cost of US$750. 
“Our goal is to eliminate energy poverty, reduce dependence on struggling state power grids and create energy self sufficiency for all the needy ones through distributed, localised and affordable renewable energy. In doing so, we believe we can collectively usher in our world a cleaner environment, new economic prosperity and social change,” reads the company ‘What We Do’ statement. “Our first offering is a highly affordable small wind turbine suitable for residential, commercial, agricultural, village electrification and other uses, which is aimed for a market launch during 2016.” Incorporated in 2015, Avant Garde claims to be a startup with a ‘green’ heart and soul. For the startup, opportunity is massive. India is the world’s sixth largest energy consumer, accounting for 3.4 per cent of global energy consumption. Federal governments in India, and the central government for that matter, are unable to bear the huge infrastructural cost required to bring electricity to remote villages. Erecting electric posts and electric lines require huge investments that could cost millions of dollars. This is where Avant Garde comes into picture. “When small wind turbine generating 1kW energy costs INR 3-7 lakh (US$4,000-10,000), our company plans to sell it at less than NR 50,000 (about US$750). Costs will decrease further through mass production,” Arun said in an interview to  The Times of India . The company launched its pilot project at a church in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram in January this year. The small wind turbine prototype that it has developed is highly scalable for power capacities of 300 kW or even higher, Arun told  e27 . “Our passionate aim is to introduce innovative, affordable and sustainable solutions that take renewable energy self sufficiency and energy empowerment to the next level through a distributed and decentralised approach using pioneering strategies the world has not witnessed yet,” the company says. This revolutionary product has also won them a spot in the Top 20 Cleantech Innovations in India. The company has also made it to the list of 10 clean energy companies from India for the “UN Sustainable Energy For All” initiative under the one billion dollar clean energy investment opportunity directory. According to the Global Wind Energy Council, the country ranks 4th in terms of global installed wind power capacity, after China, the US, and Germany. Maybe, if Avant Garde Innovations takes off, Kerala can keep the Athirappilly waterfalls untouched.

Vijayan made the announcement in the assembly after the issue was raised by Congress-led UDF Opposition in the wake of exposure of the alleged role of CPI leaders and Wayanad district Deputy Collector in the land deal, by a Malayalam TV channel. The CPI is the second largest partner in the CPI-M led LDF government. The government was committed to weed out corruption and it has the support of all service organisations, Vijayan said adding that still there were some employees who had not shed their old habits (accepting bribe). Though no corruption has taken place at the government-level, as the issue has come up, a vigilance investigation would be ordered, Vijayan said. The state government had on Monday suspended Deputy Collector T Somanathan after visuals aired by the TV channel purportedly showed him accepting bribe. Rejecting the Opposition charges that there was a 'nexus' between party leaders and officials for the conversion of land to facilitate its sale to private parties, State Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan said a comprehensive departmental inquiry by land commissioner was also on. While asserting that no transfer of land had taken place, the Minister said any one found guilty would be punished. The sting operation carried out by the channel was a deliberate attempt to malign the CPI, the Revenue Department and the ruling LDF, Chandrasekharan alleged. However, he said the party would examine if any lapse had occurred at the party-level and would take suitable action. Meanwhile, the UDF opposition members and the lone BJP member staged a walkout demanding a judicial probe into the alleged nexus between land mafia and CPI leaders, as they were not satisfied with the government response on the issue. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala charged the CPI with becoming a party that has 'dealings' with land mafia. Earlier, when the opposition UDF moved a notice for adjournment motion on the issue, the Speaker rejected it. The channel's team had approached official and some CPI district leaders posing as businessman interested in buying land for constructing a resort at Kottarthara village in Wayanad district.

KOTTAYAM: Adani Group, that is building the Rs. 6,595 crore Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd (TISL), on Tuesday announced that it would pay Rs. 5 lakh each to the family of those who died in the aftermath of cyclone Ockhi that struck the coastal areas in November last. 
Adani Ports CEO Karan Adani gave the assurance to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan during a meeting here. 
Mr. Adani, who also met the Ports Minister Kadakampally Ramachandran, is understood to have requested the Chief Minister to give an extension for completing the port project as they have suffered huge damages following the cyclone. 
The Chief Minister said the Government would not be able to give an extension and that it would have to conduct a study before giving any commitments. He also advised Mr. Adani that the company bring additional equipment to make up for the lost time, sources said. 
Two heavy dredgers got damaged when the cyclone struck, besides due to various environmental issues, lime stones from granite quarries here is not available which is the main raw material for the construction’s first phase, the Adani Group had said. 
The port was to be opened on December 5, 2019, but last month Adani Ports informed the State Government that due to the disaster they need an extension of 18 months. 
The agreement was signed on August 17, 2015 and construction work began on December 5, 2015. ALSO READ",english

It is not that the government is oblivious to the impact that the project could make, but it says it has no option but to leverage existing means to check the growing power crisis in Kerala, which partially depends on the private sector for electricity. Things are no different in other states either. While Kerala has attained almost 100 per cent electrical coverage, many parts of India still remain in the dark. For a large portion of the Indian population, electricity to this day remains a distant dream. Enter two siblings who want to make India’s energy crisis a thing of the past. The duo has developed a new solution they say will not even slightly impact the ecological balance. Avant Garde Innovations,  the startup founded by siblings Arun and Anoop George from Kerala, has come up with a low-cost wind turbine that can generate enough electricity to power an entire house for a lifetime. The size of a ceiling fan, this wind turbine can generate 5 kWh/kW per day — with just a one-time cost of US$750. 
“Our goal is to eliminate energy poverty, reduce dependence on struggling state power grids and create energy self sufficiency for all the needy ones through distributed, localised and affordable renewable energy. In doing so, we believe we can collectively usher in our world a cleaner environment, new economic prosperity and social change,” reads the company ‘What We Do’ statement. “Our first offering is a highly affordable small wind turbine suitable for residential, commercial, agricultural, village electrification and other uses, which is aimed for a market launch during 2016.” Incorporated in 2015, Avant Garde claims to be a startup with a ‘green’ heart and soul. For the startup, opportunity is massive. India is the world’s sixth largest energy consumer, accounting for 3.4 per cent of global energy consumption. Federal governments in India, and the central government for that matter, are unable to bear the huge infrastructural cost required to bring electricity to remote villages. Erecting electric posts and electric lines require huge investments that could cost millions of dollars. This is where Avant Garde comes into picture. “When small wind turbine generating 1kW energy costs INR 3-7 lakh (US$4,000-10,000), our company plans to sell it at less than NR 50,000 (about US$750). Costs will decrease further through mass production,” Arun said in an interview to  The Times of India . The company launched its pilot project at a church in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram in January this year. The small wind turbine prototype that it has developed is highly scalable for power capacities of 300 kW or even higher, Arun told  e27 . “Our passionate aim is to introduce innovative, affordable and sustainable solutions that take renewable energy self sufficiency and energy empowerment to the next level through a distributed and decentralised approach using pioneering strategies the world has not witnessed yet,” the company says. This revolutionary product has also won them a spot in the Top 20 Cleantech Innovations in India. The company has also made it to the list of 10 clean energy companies from India for the “UN Sustainable Energy For All” initiative under the one billion dollar clean energy investment opportunity directory. According to the Global Wind Energy Council, the country ranks 4th in terms of global installed wind power capacity, after China, the US, and Germany. Maybe, if Avant Garde Innovations takes off, Kerala can keep the Athirappilly waterfalls untouched.

TRIVANDRUM: The Communist Party of India (CPI), the second largest ruling coalition partner in Kerala, has sacked a leader following a land grab attempt.Vijayan Cherukara, the Wayanad district secretary of the CPI, got his marching orders hours after revenue minister E. Chandrasekharan defended his party leaders in the Assembly.The revenue authorities had on Monday suspended the hilly district’s deputy collector T Somanadh who was part of the deal.The party, however, decided to go ahead with a damages suit against Asianet News which carried out a sting operation that caught him and another local leader on camera.They offered to facilitate the transfer of some 20 acres of government land to them, and the deputy collector under suspension even took an advance bribe of Rs10,000.In the assembly, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said he was open to a probe by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB), a police wing under him.“There is a departmental enquiry (by the revenue officials) going on.

During a meeting with Mr Adani here on Tuesday, Mr Vijayan said that the contract period cannot be extended beyond December 2019. The Adani Group had earlier submitted a letter to the government seeking an extension of 16 months to complete the construction of the Vizhinjam international port.
Mr Adani told the chief minister that the project cannot be completed within the stipulated time due to the Ockhi tragedy and also because the construction works were stalled for many months due to the scarcity of granite and the protests regarding the rehabilitation package. Moreover, the two drudgers at the site, which were used to drill the sea bed, got damaged in the Ockhi cyclone. The construction can be restarted only after repairing these drudgers, said Mr Adani.
However, the chief minister said that an extension of the contract period cannot be considered as of now. He wanted Mr Adani to bring in new drudgers in place of the damaged ones immediately to ensure that the project was completed on time. As per the contract, the Adani Group should give Rs 12 lakh per day to the government if the work exceeded the contract period. The Adani Group had signed the contract with the state government to complete the first phase of the project in 1,000 working days, but this was extended to 1,460 days owing to climatic conditions. Only 40 per cent of drudging and 600 metres of the 3.1-km-long tetrapod have been completed till date. Moreover, the construction of side walls, harbour road and modern fishing harbour for native fishermen is in a limbo due to the protest over the restoration package.",english

He made this announcement while replying to a notice for an adjournment motion in the state assembly moved by Congress leader V. D. Satheesan in the wake of the exposure of the alleged role of CPI leaders and deputy collector T. Somanathan by a Malayalam TV channel. “No corruption has taken place at the government level,” he said. “However, as the issue has come up, a vigilance investigation would be ordered.”
Revenue minister E. Chandrasekharan said the state government had yesterday suspended the deputy collector after the visuals on the TV channel purportedly showed him accepting a bribe. He also termed the charges that there was a 'nexus' between party leaders and officials for the conversion of land to facilitate its sale to private parties as baseless. A comprehensive departmental inquiry by the land commissioner was going on. The party would examine if any lapse had occurred at the party-level and would take suitable action, he said.
Even though no transfer of land had taken place, the minister said, anyone found guilty would be punished. The sting operation carried out by the channel was a deliberate attempt to malign the CPI, the revenue department and the ruling LDF, Mr Chandrasekharan said. UDF members and the lone BJP member O. Rajagopal staged a walkout demanding a judicial probe into the alleged nexus between land mafia and CPI leaders after Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan rejected a discussion on the notice for the adjournment motion. The leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala charged the CPI with becoming a party that had 'dealings' with land mafia.",english

The BJP was there to support the residents who are protesting against the proposed NH bypass through their paddy fields. TNN | Apr 4, 2018, 08:22 IST KANNUR: Keezhattur , a village which has never heard of any political party other than the CPM , saw a BJP flag for the first time on Tuesday. The BJP was there to support the residents who are protesting against the proposed NH bypass through their paddy fields. The inaugural function ahead of the rally organized by the BJP, from Keezhattur to Kannur, was attended by the residents, including people like Suresh Keezhattur and Nambradath Janaki, who were CPM activists till a few months ago. Senior BJP leader and party national secretary Rahul Sinha inaugurated the march led by BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas, which concluded in Kannur town late in the evening. In his inaugural address, Sinha said that the farmers’ agitation at Keezhattur to protect their paddy fields would ultimately eliminate the CPM in Kerala, in the same way as the farmers’ agitation at Nandigram in West Bengal led to the downfall of the CPM there. “Your agitation will gain the strength to overthrow the CPM and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the next assembly election,” said Sinha, thanking ‘Vayalkilikal’ for defying the CPM’s diktats that would destroy their paddy fields. The march, ‘Keezhadangilla Keezhattur - Karshaka Raksha march’, was also attended by hundreds of BJP workers apart from senior state leaders. Meanwhile, the CPM alleged that all the anti-Left forces have come under one umbrella to target the CPM and the LDF government, and the attack on CPM is part of that conspiracy. “The CPM is against blocking development in the name of environment and this alignment was finalized by the National Highway Authority of India, while the government’s duty is to acquire the land identified for the project,” said a statement by the party. The CPM is being targeted by some vested interests for supporting a development project, said the party leadership, which questioned the alternatives proposed by the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad. Vayalkilikal denies truck with BJP Though the participation of the Vayalkilikal in the inaugural function created an impression that they were trapped in the saffron net, its leaders said nothing like that would happen. “We had sought the support of all political parties, including the CPM, and accepted the support extended by all parties, including the BJP. That does not mean that we have joined hands with the BJP, which has its own political agenda,” said Suresh Keezhattur. At the same time there was lack of vigil on the part of Vayalkilikal in sharing the stage with the BJP and hence it has been decided not to repeat it in future with any other parties, he added.

ചാണകവും മൂത്രവും ഒഴുകിപ്പോകാൻ ചാല് വേണം. പശുവിന് നിൽക്കാനും തിരിയാനുമൊക്കെയുള്ള ഇടം വേണം. ഏതൊരു പ്രഗല്‌ഭ ആർക്കിടെക്ടിനെയും കുഴക്കാൻ ഒരു തൊഴുത്ത് മതി. തൊഴുത്ത്‌ വരച്ചുതുടങ്ങിയ റിയാസ് പരാജയപ്പെട്ടില്ല. കേരളത്തിലെ എണ്ണംപറഞ്ഞ സർക്കാർ സ്ഥാപനങ്ങളിലേക്ക് റിയാസും ടീമും വരച്ചുവരച്ച് വളർന്നു.
ഇന്ന് കേരളത്തിലെ പ്രധാന സ്ഥാപനങ്ങളുടെയെല്ലാം ആർക്കിടെക്ട്‌ ചുമതല റിയാസിന്റെ സ്ഥാപനമായ ഇൻഡിഗോയ്ക്കാണ്.കൊച്ചി ഇൻഫോ പാർക്ക്, കോഴിക്കോട്‌, കണ്ണൂർ, കാസർകോട് സൈബർ പാർക്കുകൾ, കൊരട്ടി ഇൻഫോ പാർക്ക്, കൊണ്ടോട്ടി ഹജ്ജ് ഹൗസ്, കണ്ണൂരിലെ നാഷണൽ ഇൻസ്റ്റിറ്റ്യൂട്ട് ഓഫ് ടെക്‌നോളജി കാമ്പസ്, മൂന്നാർ ടീ കൗണ്ടി ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ള കെ.ടി.ഡി.സി. ഹോട്ടലുകൾ തുടങ്ങി പ്രധാന പ്രോജക്റ്റുകൾ മുഴുവൻ ഏറ്റെടുക്കുന്നത് റിയാസും സംഘവുമാണ്.
ലുലു മാളുകൾ ഡിസൈൻ ചെയ്യുന്ന ഇന്ത്യയിൽനിന്നുള്ള ഏക ഗ്രൂപ്പും റിയാസിന്റെ ഇൻഡിഗോ ആണ്. ലുലു മാളുകൾ വിദേശ എൻജിനീയർമാരായിരുന്നു ചെയ്തുവന്നിരുന്നത്. കൊച്ചിയിലെ ലുലു മാളിൽ റെസിഡന്റ് ആർക്കിടെക്ട്‌ എന്ന നിലയിലുള്ള മുഹമ്മദ് റിയാസിന്റെ ഇടപെടലോടെ തൃപ്രയാർ ലുലുവിന്റെ ചുമതല ഇൻഡിഗോയ്ക്കാണ് ലഭിച്ചത്. വിജയങ്ങളുടെ പടികളോേരാന്നായി പിന്നിടുമ്പോഴും റിയാസ് പറയും ‘ഇതൊരു ടീം വർക്കാണ് ഭായ്’. നാല്പതോളം പേരുണ്ട് എനിക്കൊപ്പം. ഇന്ത്യയിലും വിദേശത്തുമടക്കമുള്ള പ്രോജക്ടുകൾ ഏറ്റെടുത്ത് ചെയ്ത് വിജയം വരിക്കുന്നതിലെ രഹസ്യമെന്തെന്ന് ചോദിച്ചാൽ ഒറ്റവാക്കിൽ ഉത്തരം പറയും- ‘ലൈഫ് ശരിയായാൽ എല്ലാം ശരിയാവും’. പിന്നെ ഉപഭോക്താവിനോട് പാലിക്കേണ്ടുന്ന കൃത്യനിഷ്ഠ, സത്യസന്ധത, ആത്മാർഥത- ഇത്രയേ വേണ്ടു. ബാക്കിയൊക്കെ ഇങ്ങ് വന്നോളും.
പിന്നെ അധികമാർക്കുമറിയില്ലാത്ത ആ രഹസ്യം പൊട്ടിച്ചിരിച്ച് പറയും-ഞാൻ ആർക്കിടെക്ടാവാൻ ആഗ്രഹിച്ച ആളല്ല. സംഗീതം പഠിക്കണമെന്ന മോഹവുമായി ആർക്കിടെക്ട്‌ പഠിക്കുവാൻ പോയ ആളാണ് ഞാൻ. വാപ്പയ്ക്ക് സ്വന്തമായി തിയേറ്റർ ഉള്ളതിനാൽ ചെറുപ്പത്തിലേ കലകളോട് ആഭിമുഖ്യമുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ഒരു ഡ്രമ്മർ ആവുക എന്നതായിരുന്നു റിയാസിന്റെ സ്വപ്നം. നാലാളറിയുന്ന മികച്ച ഡ്രമ്മർ. അതിനാലാണ് വരയ്ക്കാനുള്ള കഴിവുകൂടി പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്താവുന്ന ആർക്കിടെക്റ്റർ കോഴ്‌സ് തിരഞ്ഞെടുത്തത്.
1994-ൽ കോഴിക്കോട് നാഷണൽ ഇൻസ്റ്റിറ്റ്യൂട്ട് ഓഫ് ഡിസൈനിൽ (NID) അഡ്മിഷൻ നേടി. പഠിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുമ്പോൾ തന്നെ കാലിക്കറ്റ് സർവകലാശാലാ ഡി. സോൺ, ഇന്റർസോൺ മത്സരങ്ങളിൽ മികച്ച ഡ്രമ്മർക്കുള്ള പുരസ്‌കാരം പലതവണ തേടിയെത്തി. ഒപ്പം സംഗീതത്തെ സ്‌നേഹിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ കൂട്ടുകളും കിട്ടി.
കോഴ്‌സ് കഴിഞ്ഞയുടൻ ബാംഗ്ലൂരിൽ ഒരു ആർക്കിടെക്റ്റ് സ്ഥാപനത്തിൽ ജോലിക്ക് കയറി.പകൽ പത്തുമുതൽ അഞ്ചുമണിവരെ ആർക്കിടെക്ചറൽ ജോലി, വൈകീട്ട് ആറുമുതൽ രാത്രി 12 മണി വരെ ബാംഗ്ലൂരിലെ നൈറ്റ് ക്ലബ്ബിൽ ഡ്രമ്മറുടെ ജോലിയും. ആർക്കിടെക്ചറൽ ജോലിവഴി മാസം ആയിരം രൂപയാണ് ലഭിച്ചിരുന്നതെങ്കിൽ ഡ്രമ്മർ എന്ന നിലയിൽ മാസം പതിനായിരം രൂപവരെ പ്രതിഫലം ലഭിച്ചിരുന്നുവെന്ന് റിയാസ് പറയുന്നു.വ്യത്യസ്തത ഒന്നുമില്ലാതെ ഒരേ വേദിയിൽ കുറേക്കാലം സംഗീതം അവതരിപ്പിച്ചതോടെ റിയാസിന് മടുത്തുതുടങ്ങി. പുതുതായി ഒന്നും ചെയ്യുവാനില്ലാതെ സംഗീതമിങ്ങനെ കുടിയൻമാർക്ക് മുന്നിൽ അവതരിപ്പിച്ചുതീർക്കേണ്ടുന്ന ഒന്നാണോ എന്ന്‌ മനസ്സിലുയർന്നു. ബെംഗളൂരു വിട്ട് നേരെ കേരളത്തിലേക്ക്. ഇൻഡിഗോ എന്ന സ്വന്തം സ്ഥാപനം തുടങ്ങി. ഒപ്പം സംഗീതക്കൂട്ടുകാരുമായി ചേർന്ന് ‘ജിഗ്‌സോപസിൽ’ എന്ന കേരളത്തിലെ ആദ്യത്തെ ബാൻഡ് ഗ്രൂപ്പിന് തൃശ്ശൂരിൽ തുടക്കമായി.
22 വർഷങ്ങൾക്കു മുൻപ്, ഗിറ്റാറിസ്റ്റ് ജോണും ഗായകൻ ആനന്ദരാജും ആയിരുന്നു കൂട്ടുകാർ. എം.ടി.വി.യിലും വി.ടി.വി.യിലും വരെ പരിപാടി അവതരിപ്പിച്ചു. നാല്‌ റോക്ക് മ്യൂസിക് കാസറ്റുകൾ സംഘം പുറത്തിറക്കിയെങ്കിലും ശുദ്ധസംഗീതത്തിന്റെ ആസ്വാദകർ ബാൻഡ് ഗ്രൂപ്പിനെ സ്വീകരിച്ചില്ല.ശുദ്ധസംഗീതമൊഴികെ മറ്റൊന്നും സംഗീതമല്ലെന്ന് കരുതിയിരുന്ന ഒരു തലമുറയ്ക്ക് മുന്നിൽ റിയാസും സംഘവും തോറ്റു. തോല്പിച്ചു എന്നതാവും കൂടുതൽ ശരി. റോക്ക് സംഗീതത്തിന് ഇന്ത്യയിൽ ഭാവിയില്ല എന്ന് വിലപിച്ച് ജോൺ സ്വീഡനിലേക്ക് വിമാനം കയറി. ആനന്ദരാജും ഇന്ത്യ വിട്ടതോടെ റിയാസ് സംഗീതത്തെ വീണ്ടും വരകളിലേക്ക് വഴിതിരിച്ചുവിട്ടു.സംഗീതം ഉള്ളിലുള്ളതിനാൽ സംഗീതത്തിന്റെ എന്തെങ്കിലുമൊക്കെ വരയിലും പ്രതിഫലിക്കുമെന്ന് റിയാസ്. ഇന്ത്യയിലെ അഞ്ചാമത്തെ നിഫ്റ്റ് (നാഷണൽ ഇൻസ്റ്റിറ്റ്യൂട്ട് ഓഫ് ഫാഷൻ ടെക്‌നോളജി) കാമ്പസ് പ്ലാനിനായി പ്രോജക്ട് സമർപ്പിക്കുമ്പോൾ ഇന്ത്യയിലെ മറ്റ് പ്രഗല്‌ഭ ആർക്കിടെക്റ്റുകൾക്കൊപ്പമായിരുന്നു റിയാസും മത്സരിച്ചത്. റിയാസാവട്ടെ ഒരു നിഫ്റ്റ്‌പോലും കണ്ടിട്ടുമുwണ്ടായിരുന്നില്ല.
ഒന്നും കാണാതെ ചെയ്തതിനാൽ പുതുമകൾ പലതും അവതരിപ്പിക്കാനായി. അതിനാൽ റിയാസിന്റെ പ്രോജക്ടാണ് അംഗീകരിക്കപ്പെട്ടത്. അതാണ് ഇന്ത്യയിലെ പ്രധാന ആർക്കിടെക്റ്റുകളുടെ പട്ടികയിലേക്ക് റിയാസിന് ഇടംകൊടുത്തത്.ആ വിജയം മിത്രങ്ങളെയും ശത്രുക്കളെയും ഉണ്ടാക്കി. ഒരിക്കൽ കള്ളുകുടിയരെന്നും കഞ്ചാവെന്നും പരിഹസിച്ച ജിഗ്‌സോപസിലിന്റെ 20 വർഷം മുൻപത്തെ ‘നട നട’ എന്ന പാട്ട് ഇപ്പോൾ ആളുകൾ കാണുന്നു, അംഗീകരിക്കുന്നു. രണ്ട് ലക്ഷത്തിലേറെ ആളുകൾ അന്നത്തെ പാട്ട് കണ്ടുകഴിഞ്ഞു. അംഗീകാരം എത്ര വൈകിയായാലും തേടിവരും. ജനം അംഗീകരിച്ചില്ലെങ്കിലും അവനവന് സന്തോഷം തോന്നുന്നതെന്തോ അത് ചെയ്ത് ജീവിക്കുക. ജീവിതം ശരിയായാൽ എല്ലാം ശരിയാവും. തേടിയെത്തുന്ന അവസരങ്ങൾ എത്ര ചെറുതുമായിക്കൊള്ളട്ടെ, ഒന്നിനെയും നിരാകരിക്കരുതെന്ന് അനുഭവങ്ങൾക്ക് അടിവരയിട്ട് റിയാസ് പറയും. തൊഴുത്ത്‌ വരച്ചുതരാനാവശ്യപ്പെട്ടവർ അടുത്തതായി ആവശ്യപ്പെടുന്നത് എൻജിനീയറിങ് കോളേജ് വരയ്ക്കുവാനാണ്.
മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ മുതൽ ശ്രീലങ്കൻ മന്ത്രിമാർവരെ നീളുന്ന സൗഹൃദവലയമാണ് റിയാസിനുള്ളത്. ട്വിറ്ററിൽ രണ്ടുലക്ഷത്തിനുമേൽ ഫോളോവേഴ്‌സും റിയാസിനുണ്ട്.

The Kerala government on Tuesday refused to give the Adani group more time to commission the first phase of the country’s first International Multipurpose Deepwater Seaport project at Vizhinjam, The Hindu reported. 
The port, located around 16 km south of the capital Thiruvananthapuram is being built and will be operated on a public private partnership basis between the Kerala government and Adani Vizhinjam Ports Ltd. 
The group began construction in December 2015, and was to commission Phase I of the project on December 4, 2019. It has, however, asked the government for a 16-month extension, citing the damage caused by the Ockhi cyclone in November 2017. The cyclone damaged two dredgers, which have been pulled out for repairs, the group said.
Adani group said construction work had to be stalled for months as there was a scarcity of granite, and pointed out that protests by the local population since October 2017 over delayed compensation for their land was also affecting the pace of the project, the Deccan Chronicle reported.
On Tuesday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told Karan Adani, the CEO of the Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd , that the government will not extend the deadline, but added that all clearances...

The Manorama report, based on a reply of the chief minister in the legislative assembly, reveals that Kunjananthan walked out of jail thrice in June and August, 2016, soon after the left government assumed office. 
He enjoyed the facility for 79 days in 2016 and 98 days in 2017. According to the report, he was allowed ordinary parole seven times and emergency leave eight times. 
A murder that put CPI(M) in a fix 
Chandrasekharan was killed three years after he quit the CPI(M) and founded the RMP in 2009. Though the CPI(M) argued that party men were not involved and that the crime was borne out of personal animosity, the arrest of several partymen put the party in a tight spot. 
Kunjananthan was the 13th accused in the case. Along with him, Kunnummakkara local committee member K.C. Ramachandran and former branch secretary Manojan, were also found guilty of conspiracy in the case. While pronouncing the verdict, the special court established “political animosity” as the main motive behind the “barbaric” act. TAGS ",english

The inaugural function ahead of the rally organized by the BJP, from Keezhattur to Kannur, was attended by the residents, including people like Suresh Keezhattur and Nambradath Janaki, who were CPM activists till a few months ago. Senior BJP leader and party national secretary Rahul Sinha inaugurated the march led by BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas, which concluded in Kannur town late in the evening.
In his inaugural address, Sinha said that the farmers’ agitation at Keezhattur to protect their paddy fields would ultimately eliminate the CPM in Kerala, in the same way as the farmers’ agitation at Nandigram in West Bengal led to the downfall of the CPM there. “Your agitation will gain the strength to overthrow the CPM and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the next assembly election,” said Sinha, thanking ‘Vayalkilikal’ for defying the CPM’s diktats that would destroy their paddy fields.
The march, ‘Keezhadangilla Keezhattur - Karshaka Raksha march’, was also attended by hundreds of BJP workers apart from senior state leaders.
Meanwhile, the CPM alleged that all the anti-Left forces have come under one umbrella to target the CPM and the LDF government, and the attack on CPM is part of that conspiracy. “The CPM is against blocking development in the name of environment and this alignment was finalized by the National Highway Authority of India, while the government’s duty is to acquire the land identified for the project,” said a statement by the party. The CPM is being targeted by some vested interests for supporting a development project, said the party leadership, which questioned the alternatives proposed by the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad.
Vayalkilikal denies truck with BJP
Though the participation of the Vayalkilikal in the inaugural function created an impression that they were trapped in the saffron net, its leaders said nothing like that would happen. “We had sought the support of all political parties, including the CPM, and accepted the support extended by all parties, including the BJP. That does not mean that we have joined hands with the BJP, which has its own political agenda,” said Suresh Keezhattur. At the same time there was lack of vigil on the part of Vayalkilikal in sharing the stage with the BJP and hence it has been decided not to repeat it in future with any other parties, he added.",english

The UDF opposition was levelling ""politically motivated"" allegations against the Idukki MP, the Chief Minister said in the Assembly.
The MP was in the centre of a controversy last year after the Revenue officials had cancelled the original title deeds relating to about 20 acres of land in his possession and that of his family members in Idukki district as it was found to be issued on ""improper grounds.""
During the question hour, Vijayan said, ""Joyce George had not encroached any land. This is the government stand."" Earlier, Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan had also maintained that the left independent MP was not involved in any land grab and the one in his possession and his relatives' were 'hereditary.'
The opposition raised the issue when the minister was detailing the steps taken by the government to evict illegal encroachments.Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala took objection to the comments made by Chandrasekharan and said the ownership dispute of the land of Joyce George was pending before the court.
It was not proper on part of the minister to make such a statement in favour of the left MP when the case was pending, he said.

Weddings pictures are supposed to be filled with happy memories that last a lifetime, not just for the couple, but their family members and guests as well. But a recent incident in Kerala has left everyone rattled after it was found that a studio taking pictures at a function was morphing the pictures for pornographic purposes . 
Several women from Kerala's Kozhikode district have now approached the police claiming to be victims of cybercrime. The incident came to light when a woman found out that her pictures taken during a function were morphed and circulated on social media platforms, NDTV reported. 
The woman registered a complaint against the photographers of Sadayam Shoot & Edit based in Vadakara town. The police have now shuttered the photo studio and confiscated several documents. Thousands of photographs were also found inside a hard disk seized by the police. 
The cops have nabbed two owners of the studio -- Satheesan and Dinesh (second names not provided) -- from Wayanad. However, the prime suspect named Bibeesh (second name not provided) is still absconding. After probing into the matter, police officials confirmed that the accused have confessed to their crimes. 
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier confirmed that a special investigation team was set up to probe the issue. The CM addressed the issue at the state assembly in reply to a question put forth by political leader CK Nanu, according to NDTV.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday dismissed the Congress-led UDF Opposition’s allegations of land encroachment against LDF independent MP, Joyce George, saying there were “politically motivated.” 
The UDF opposition was levelling “politically motivated” allegations against the Idukki MP, the Chief Minister said in the Assembly. 
The MP was in the centre of a controversy last year after the Revenue officials had cancelled the original title deeds relating to about 20 acres of land in his possession and that of his family members in Idukki district as it was found to be issued on “improper grounds.” 
During the question hour, Vijayan said, “Joyce George had not encroached any land. This is the government stand.” 
Earlier, Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan had also maintained that the left independent MP was not involved in any land grab and the one in his possession and his relatives’ were ‘hereditary.’ 
The opposition raised the issue when the minister was detailing the steps taken by the government to evict illegal encroachments. 
Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala took objection to the comments made by Chandrasekharan and said the ownership dispute of the land of Joyce George was pending before the court. 
It was not proper on part of the minister to make such a statement in favour of the left MP when the case was pending, he said. 
As many as 1,477 cases of encroachment had been reported across the 14 districts of the state after the LDF government came to power. Of this, 606 encroachments had been evicted, he added.   More Related News",english

The Left government's home department in Kerala is having a tough time like never before. The state’s police force which comes under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has been caught misbehaving with the common man on the street at an alarming frequency over the last one month. 
In the last few weeks alone more than half a dozen such cases where the men in uniform abuse, harass and even beat up unsuspecting citizens have been reported from across the state. 
With the opposition led by the Congress party raising the issue in the state Assembly and even staging a walkout following a decline by the Speaker to move an adjournment motion on the issue last week, the government had to openly admit the error and call for corrective steps.

""We are acknowledging the situation and let me assure everyone that strict action will be taken against those found to be misbehaving with the general public. The department will be a calling a special meeting to address the issue at the earliest,"" Director General of Police (DGP) Lokanath Behera told media persons this week. 
But not everyone is ready to buy the words of the DGP and there is a clear-cut reason for that. In the last two years alone many such situations have come about when the men in uniform have been found wanting when it comes to public behaviour and the state police chief and the department had hardly moved a finger to nip such attempts in the bud. 
‘Watered-down policy’ of the Left 
A year ago in April 2017, the state watched in shock as the mother of Jishnu Pranoy, a boy who had allegedly committed suicide in mysterious circumstances in a private engineering college in the state, was dragged on to the streets along with her relatives because they had dared to protest in front of the DGP’s office against police inaction in the case. 
The uproar was so big that even the Supreme Court citing the incident asked if the state actually had a DGP who could maintain law and order while hearing the former DGP TP Senkumar’s removal case. 
Activists say that the Left government’s inability to implement its policy in the home department is the real cause of trouble which has given rise to the feeling that the police have a free hand in the state, an issue that became a hot topic in the recently concluded state conference of the CPM. 
""The Left has a policy of governance which is pro-poor, pro-people. It is when that gets diluted instead of getting implemented in the most important department which is the Home, the state moves towards a police raj. The government should show spine to take stringent action against erring policemen rather than shy away from with the excuse of it affecting the morale of the force. Only that will send out the message,"" said social activist NM Pearson. 
Last week a retired railway station master was punched in the face by an assistant sub-inspector for allegedly obstructing the convoy of the governor. The bleeding face of the senior citizen with a ruptured nose took the social media by storm forcing the DGP to issue a circular asking all cops on traffic duty to attend a one-day training session in civility. 
Another video that got wide circulation showed Manjudas, a sub-inspector at Erattupetta in central Kerala, showering expletives on bikers. 
Again in March, two bikers lost their lives after they crashed while being forcibly stopped by cops checking for helmetless driving in Alappuzha. 
CN Shareef, a photojournalist of a vernacular daily was beaten up in a police station at Malappuram in north Kerala. His crime was that he had dared to click the picture of a protest billboard kept at the Areekode police station. 
The list of police excesses over the last few months is an uncomfortably long one. But in spite of the DGP’s circular calling for training, it had little effect on the ground. 
Even before the ink had dried another incident of police misbehaviour was reported on the same evening soon after the day’s training on behaviour was wound up. 
Since the Left came to power in 2016, the state’s police force has often been on the wrong side of the law. The proof lies not just in the umpteen number of incidents of misbehaviour and unruly conduct but also in the steady rebuke that the department had been receiving from the judiciary during the same period. 
There are political observers who feel that it is not the lack of a policy on the part of the government that is driving the police excesses but rather it’s a well-crafted agenda of the Left that is at the root of the issue. 
""This Left government led by Pinarayi Vijayan seems to have adopted a line of resisting all dissenting voices using the state machinery. The police are a most important tool in implementing this agenda. When that happens obviously the police will also take the law into their hands and behave according to their whims and fancies. I think the present police misbehaviour is a fall out of this government’s policy of gagging any form of democratic dissent,"" CR Neelakandan, an anti-corruption activist-turned-politician with the Aam Admi Party (AAP) told Firstpost . 
Lack of leadership 
Most of the top brass of the police whom Firstpost talked to were worried about the audacity with which the cops at the lower rung keep breaking the directions of the state police chief. 
Despite bringing out circulars and verbal ultimatums that those found taking law into their hands would be dealt with an iron hand, there is hardly anyone who shies away from doing what they deem fit on the ground. 
Retired officers say that this 'non-ownership attitude' of a few puts the entire force's reputation at stake and it is also the crux of the entire problem. 
Subash Babu is a retired superintendent of police who had also spent considerable time at the Police Training College in Thrissur. 
Babu says that the lack of strong leadership at the top is killing the force and that there is hardly any uniformity in the 'uniformed force' in the state at the moment. 
""Police is a team work where ownership is very important. When you have a DGP at the top who hardly has a personal connect with the even the district police chiefs what else do you expect? See when a policeman does something which he very well knows will bring disrepute to his senior officer and the force, it should make him think twice before doing it. But he hardly cares because unlike our times when we used to have a personal connect with the top brass, there is hardly any such feeling nowadays. It’s a failure of the leadership to inspire,"" Babu told Firstpost . 
That the current DGP Lokanath Behera had come to the seat under controversial circumstances after the state government shunted out former DGP Senkumar also hardly helped Behera’s cause in gaining the trust of his force. 
Senkumar returned for a month with a Supreme Court order before retiring to pave way for Behera. But since then the new DGP has hardly been able to fit the bill of a Senkumar who was well known for his personal touch with senior and junior officers in the force. 
Behera also earned the displeasure of the apex court when it openly criticised him for the way he dealt the protest of Jishnu Pranoy's mother. For over two years the DGP has hardly been a rallying point for the force is something which many see as a big drawback. 
Political godfathers 
Policemen having political godfathers are nothing new. But the system in Kerala is such that the nexus between the force and the political leadership runs very deep. 
Most of it becomes much evident when a cadre-based party like the CPM takes control over the reins of power. The party decides where to put which officer and once it is a political appointment even the cop knows that the politician will watch his back. 
Such is the nexus between the political class and men in uniform that any disciplinary action is also met with a high amount of resistance using the politicians. It is here that Kerala Police Association (KPA) comes into the picture. Formed for protecting the welfare of policemen and women, it is now a centre of misuse claims retried senior officers. 
""It is very difficult to see that on the surface. But certainly the association is what bails out erring policemen. One suspension for a few days and soon the cop makes a re-entry through the back door and gets transferred for a new posting. All this is stage managed by the association by putting pressure on the politician who then puts pressure on the senior officer to ensure that any departmental enquiry is stalled. This is how they get away. So they have no fear at all,"" said former DGP Siby Mathews. 
Babu also said that the present atmosphere in police stations across the state hardly make it a unified force. 
""Almost every police station in Kerala is a divided house now. On one side you have two political groups, the CPM and the Congress right inside the station among the men. Then you have two other sets where one will be a super discipline group and the other an indifferent group. It’s an eternal power struggle between these groups which runs a police station nowadays, leaving little room for control from the top officers,"" said Babu. 
Stressed force? 
The Kerala State Police Complaints Authority is the only watchdog where citizens can approach with complaints against the police. In 2015, the then chairperson of KSPCA, justice Narayana Kurup had openly said that young officers of the force need to reform themselves and not try to behave like super cops. 
Kurup had even suggested to the government of the day that the 2014 batch of sub-inspectors need to be recalled for training since the authority had received innumerable complaints against them. But nothing had been done since then. 
""They are not able to reconcile the newly experienced sense of authority to the reality of citizens' rights. That is the major problem. You can only change this by reinforcing on them the idea that citizens are not here to live by your command but you are here to help the citizens in need. The policemen need to understand authority in the context of protection and not power,"" said former DGP Jacob Punnose. 
But psychologists said that stress plays a crucial role and it is easy to blame the policeman for his behaviour. 
""Displaced aggression is a common phenomenon here. Take the instance of road rage shown by traffic policemen. Here is a man who is under pressure from his superiors, working under poor conditions, facing disparity in pay for the kind of work he does. It doesn’t take much for him to lose his cool. What is needed is a scientific approach to recruitment as well as training. You need to equip him to meet the challenge,"" said psychologist KS David.

The Adani group pointed out that protests by the local population over delayed compensation for their land was also affecting the pace of construction. | AFP 
The Kerala government on Tuesday refused to give the Adani group more time to commission the first phase of the country’s first International Multipurpose Deepwater Seaport project at Vizhinjam, The Hindu reported. 
The port, located around 16 km south of the capital Thiruvananthapuram is being built and will be operated on a public private partnership basis between the Kerala government and Adani Vizhinjam Ports Ltd. 
The group began construction in December 2015, and was to commission Phase I of the project on December 4, 2019. It has, however, asked the government for a 16-month extension, citing the damage caused by the Ockhi cyclone in November 2017. The cyclone damaged two dredgers, which have been pulled out for repairs, the group said. 
Adani group said construction work had to be stalled for months as there was a scarcity of granite, and pointed out that protests by the local population since October 2017 over delayed compensation for their land was also affecting the pace of the project, the Deccan Chronicle reported. 
On Tuesday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told Karan Adani, the CEO of the Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd , that the government will not extend the deadline, but added that all clearances required to source the granite will be given within a month, The Hindu reported. 
The government said its decision not to extend the deadline followed a study by an independent engineer appointed for the project who ruled out the need for an extension. 
A spokesperson for Adani Vizhinjam Ports Ltd told The Hindu the group will “put in all efforts to complete the project”. Support our journalism by subscribing to Scroll+ here . We welcome your comments at .",english

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala government today transferred Thiruvanthapuram sub-collector Divya S Iyer, IAS, to the post of Deputy Secretary in the Local self-government department. 
A decision to this effect was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, official sources said. 
Though officials said the transfer of Divya, wife of Congress MLA K S Sabrinathan, was a routine one, her shifting comes in the wake of an allegation that she had transferred about 27 cents of government land to a private individual violating norms. 
Sabarinathan, son of late Congress leader G Karthikeyan, has said the charges made by CPI-M MLA V Joy, were politically motivated. 
A probe by the Land Revenue Commissioner into the matter is going on.

TVM: Kerala's Communists are on the defensive. A flurry of media exposes in recent days showed how their leaders-- mostly those of the CPI -- are involved in shady deals to assign government lands to private entities through a nexus between revenue officials and local party leaders. CPI secretary of Wayanad district, Vijayan Cherukara, has been suspected by the state party leadership after a TV channel beamed visuals of how he involved himself in a racket to assign four acres of government land to a private party with the involvement of a sub-collector-level revenue (Land Board Authority) official at the district level.  

The CPI is widely perceived as being the most corrupt political party in the state, currently headed by a long-time trade union leader with questionable reputation -- Kanam Rajendran -- against whom itself there have been serious allegations of corruption. In one instance, accusation was that at his instance, the state forest minister K Raju of the CPI produced papers in a government land ownership case to the high court in such a way that the state lost the case and a private individual benefited. The state lost a huge stretch of land. 

An allegation, certainly with substance, is that  the CPI is using the revenue department and its senior officials to extract maximum money when the party is in power. Officials are forced to report to the houses of district party leaders, in many districts, to hand over ""half the bribe collections"" in every office. As a result, staff at revenue offices allegedly doubled the bribe amounts for moving every paper on their desks, it is alleged. 

Another accusation that is taking the latest round of the media exposes is the palming away of a stretch of government land in Varkala, Thiruvananthapuram district, to a private individual who was a close associate of a Congress MLA. This was done allegedly through the good offices of his wife, a senior IAS offcial. The local CPI MLA Joy's name has also been dragged into the alleged misappropriation, for which  officials were allegedly made use of. A connection between politicians and officials in such cases is common. 

A Gulf-returned technician, who tried to set up a workshop in a village in Kollam district committed suicide a month ago, after local CPI leaders demanded a huge bribe from him on the premise that his workshop was erected on a reclaimed paddyland. Under the state's rules, reclamation of paddylands is not allowed, but this clause is used by politicans, especially leaders of the CPI that handles the revenue (land-related) department, to browbeat land-fillers and extract money from them to use such lands for any purpose.  

CPI, which does not have much mass support but gets into power repeatedly as an ally in the CPI(M)-led LDF, grabs the revenue department every time the left takes power in the state, and allegedly use the department, as also the forest department, to make money for its leaders at various levels. At the same time, the party and Kanam Rajendran had been adopting public postures of being more clean than the CPI(M), and transparent in its functioning. The party has some influence in two southern districts -- Kollam and Pathanamthitta -- and is a washout elsewhere, other than for a crop of eagle-eyed leaders.  

Corruption exists in the 'big brother party' in the LDF, the CPI(M), too, but it is on a much lower scale as per public perception. Its leaders attend to local issues with a rare frenzy, and act in more responsible ways, a reason why the party maintains its hold over the state. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself faced allegations of 'corruption' in the Lavalin power equipment deal, while he was power minister in the 1990s.  But, it was widely seen as an instance of some ""commissions"" from Lavalin going into the state party's kitty or for a pet cancer care project in the CPI(M) bastion of Kannur. A case in this respect is still ongoing. At a personal level, Vijayan leads a simple life but connects himself with some big-time businessmen in the state, some of them so-called party sympathisers or fund-raisers.  

There, of late, are some allegations against the sons of state CPI(M) secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Even in these, no finger is pointed directly at Balakrishnan, per se, though he too is under a cloud over the alleged actions  of his sons, mainly the ones relating to their business loans and deals in the Gulf region. The names of sons of some other CPI(M) leaders from Kannur too crop up in such contexts. IHN-NN

P.V. Pushpaja, who retired as Principal of the Nehru Arts & Science College here, formally lodged a complaint at the Hosdurg police station on Wednesday. 
Dr. Pushpaja, in her complaint, blamed three Students Federation of India workers of the college for bursting crackers and distributing sweets among students as a farewell party was progressing on the campus on March 28. 
The teacher also referred to footage circulated in social media about posters “conveying condolence to a teacher who had died in the hearts of students”. 
Speaking to the media, Dr. Pushpaja said she welcomed the statement of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the Assembly that action would be taken against guilty students. 
She said no teacher should undergo such a traumatic experience at the end of over three-decade stint as faculty of a reputed institution. 
DYFI statement 
Meanwhile, the DYFI, in a statement, said a move was on to politicise and blow the issue out of proportion by holding the SFI responsible for the unsavoury act, which it said needed to be condemned. 
Stating that the Principal had infringed the “democratic rights” of students in recent years, the DYFI called for an introspection on the reasons behind such instances on college campuses. 
It also decried the moves of the college management to approach the Kerala High Court seeking a ban on campus politics in the light of the incident. 
On Wednesday, the SFI convened a “resistance meet” on the campus to counter the allegations levelled against it by the Principal, a section of teachers, the KSU, and the district unit of the BJP. 
The college had suspended three students, including SFI district committee member Muhammed Anees, in connection with the unsavoury incidents on the campus.",english

THE general council of CITU which met in Kozhikode from March 23-26, gave the clarion call to the working class of the country to participate in huge numbers in the rally in the national capital Delhi on September 5, to highlight its demands. The general council expressed its great happiness that the two major countrywide organisations of the peasants and agricultural workers, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) and the All India Agricultural Workers’ Union (AIAWU) agreed to join the rally. Thus for the first time largest section of the toiling people – industrial workers from the organised and unorganised sectors from the urban and rural areas, scheme workers and peasants and agricultural workers will jointly march in the national capital for the first time voicing their demands. 
349 members of the general council including 53 women from 22 states in the country attended the general council in addition to 14 invitees from the fraternal trade union organisations and 12 special invitees from different states.
The CITU general council meeting started with hoisting of the CITU flag in the morning on March 23 by Hemalata, president of CITU. Floral tributes were paid at the martyrs’ column by Hemalata and Tapan Sen, general secretary of CITU, followed by all the office bearers and general council members. The photo of Bhagat Singh, who was martyred along with his comrades-in-arms Sukh Dev and Rajguru, on the same day in 1931, was garlanded by Tapan Sen, Hemalata and others.
Elamaram Kareem, national secretary of CITU and chairman of the reception committee welcomed the general council members to the historical city of Kozhikode, which had the great legacy of anti-colonial and working class struggles. The city was a hub of activity of legendary leaders like P Krishna Pillai, EMS Namboodiripad and AK Gopalan. The reception committee organised a series of programmes including seminars on various subjects, family get together, general body meetings etc on the occasion of the CITU general council meeting in the city. The expenditure for the meeting was met exclusively with the contributions from the members of CITU in the district.
Hemalata presided over the meeting. In the inaugural session, the general council unanimously passed two important resolutions – one condemning the barbaric attacks including burning and vandalising of offices, physical attacks, extortion, forceful occupying of offices of CITU and other Left oriented organisations by the BJP; attacks on the cadres and supporters of the Left parties and CITU in Tripura. It extended solidarity to the Left and CITU cadres and expressed hope that they will be able to create confidence among the people to resist these attacks soon.
The general council also congratulated the working class of Kerala and all the 16 trade unions who have jointly decided to go on a state wide strike against the decision of the BJP led government at the centre to introduce Fixed Term Employment in all sectors through a notification, despite the strong opposition expressed by all the central trade unions to an earlier attempt towards this. It called upon all its state committees to hold demonstrations and rallies all over the country, in support of the joint strike in Kerala.
The general council had a detailed discussion on the existing political and economic situation in the country and the conditions of the working class and other sections of the toiling people, on the basis of the report placed by Tapan Sen. It has decided to intensify independent and joint struggles, involve all sections of the working people in these struggles and expose the anti-worker, anti-people and anti-national character of the neoliberal policies and the political parties pursuing these policies despite strong resistance from the workers and others. The general council of CITU decided that neoliberalism, communalism and authoritarianism, the three major features of the BJP led Modi government have to be fought unitedly by the working class at the same time as they are interlinked. As part of these efforts, the general council called upon all its state committees to:
Play an active role in the effective implementation of the call of the Jan Ekta Jan Adhikar Andolan (JEJAA) to hold demonstrations all over the country on May 23, on the eve of the BJP led Modi government completing its four years in office. It urged upon them to expose the failures of the Modi government with the slogan ‘Modi Sarkar ka Char Sal – Phol Khol: Hall Bol’ through a week long wide campaign before that day Participate in the district level court arrest programme called by the AIKS on August 9, on the occasion of the ‘Quit India Day’. All the state committees and affiliated unions of CITU were called upon to mobilise workers in large numbers in the court arrest programme highlighting their own specific demands. On August 14, workers across the country will participate in the night long ‘Samoohik Jagaran’ programme to focus on their demands and expose the failure of the ruling classes till today in implementing the vision of our freedom fighters of a self reliant, progressive and advanced country free of poverty, hunger, illiteracy etc In August, CITU will conduct five regional jathas to cover the entire country; in addition, state level jathas will be organised in all states to cover all the district headquarters and blocks. This will culminate in a massive mobilisation of not less than two lakh workers in Delhi on September 5. These workers will be joined by thousands of peasants and agricultural workers The CITU general council also discussed the draft of the updated document on organisation placed by Tapan Sen and adopted it unanimously. Hemalata presented the proposal for future organisational and movemental tasks along with a detailed plan for their effective implementation. This too was unanimously adopted.
The plan chalked out by the CITU general council combined both organisational and movemental tasks. The updated document on organisation will be translated into local languages and discussed in the state level workshops. The state committees will prepare their own document on organisation suitable to their states but in line with the document adopted in the general council. The updated document on organisation will be taken to all members of the CITU committees up to the lowest level to facilitate its effective implementation. The state level workshops will also concretely plan the implementation of the CITU slogan of ‘Reach the unreached’ and ‘link issues with policies and expose politics behind the policies’ utilising the campaign. The number of workers to be approached, methods of campaign etc will also be finalised in the workshops. It was decided to undertake this type of exercise in all state level unions and also at the district level.
The 12-point charter of demands of the joint trade union movement, the 10 points adopted by the CITU secretariat will be highlighted during the campaign. In addition, the issues of all sections of the toiling people – employment, housing, education, health, social justice, women’s empowerment, agrarian distress etc will be highlighted. The campaign will also highlight concrete alternatives on all these issues, explaining to the people how it is possible to achieve their demands with the existing resources, if there is political will.
The general council of CITU passed unanimous resolutions supporting the 3 days’ strike by the Regional Rural Bank employees, demanding the government of India to appeal against the recent Supreme Court judgement on SC/ST Act, on the IT/ITES employees, on Palestine and on Rohingyas issue.
Hemalata concluded the meeting of the general council expressing confidence that by implementing the decisions this general council meeting will turn into a historic one in the annals of not only the CITU but of the trade union movement of the country. She thanked the Kerala state committee of CITU and the working class of Kerala for hosting the general council meeting and making excellent arrangements for its success.
AK Ramesh proposed the vote of thanks on behalf of the reception committee. A massive public meeting was held in the evening of March 26 on the sea beach. Large number of women workers participated in the meeting which was presided by TP Ramakrishnan, minister for Labour in the LDF government of Kerala. Pinarayi Vijayan, chief minister of Kerala, Tapan Sen, Hemalata, AK Padmanabhan, Anathalavottam Anandan, president of Kerala state committee of CITU, addressed the gathering.
The general council meeting as well as the huge participation of the working class and the speech of the chief minister of Kerala created great enthusiasm and confidence among the participants.
Resolution in Support of the Strike by Trade Unions in Kerala 
THIS general council of CITU, being held at Kozhikode, Kerala on March 23-26, congratulates the working people of Kerala and its leadership – the state units of central trade unions and state unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, UTUC, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, STU, HMPK, TUCI, AKTU, KTUC, KTUC(J), KTUC(M), INLC – for the bold and timely response they have shown by giving one day statewide strike on April 2, against the draconian notification of the government of India, replacing permanent employment with term based employment and extending the fixed term employment to all establishments, thereby enslaving the workers and throwing them to the mercy of the corporates, permanency of the job is thereby given a good bye. This move which is a part of the ongoing implementation of the neoliberal policies that caters to the needs of the big corporates, has to be fought tooth and nail and the decision of the working men and women of the Kerala state would necessarily enthuse the entire Indian people who are in militant struggle against the anti-people policies of the government of India.
This general council calls upon all affiliates, other fraternal organisations and CITU state committees to organise protest demonstrations in solidarity with this strike action.

Kerala now has a new dread on the streets, an abusive police force that hapless citizens always fear India Naveen Nair Apr 04, 2018 19:48:16 IST Tweet The Left government's home department in Kerala is having a tough time like never before. The state’s police force which comes under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has been caught misbehaving with the common man on the street at an alarming frequency over the last one month.
In the last few weeks alone more than half a dozen such cases where the men in uniform abuse, harass and even beat up unsuspecting citizens have been reported from across the state.
With the opposition led by the Congress party raising the issue in the state Assembly and even staging a walkout following a decline by the Speaker to move an adjournment motion on the issue last week, the government had to openly admit the error and call for corrective steps.
Kerala Police personnel. Getty images ""We are acknowledging the situation and let me assure everyone that strict action will be taken against those found to be misbehaving with the general public. The department will be a calling a special meeting to address the issue at the earliest,"" Director General of Police (DGP) Lokanath Behera told media persons this week.
But not everyone is ready to buy the words of the DGP and there is a clear-cut reason for that. In the last two years alone many such situations have come about when the men in uniform have been found wanting when it comes to public behaviour and the state police chief and the department had hardly moved a finger to nip such attempts in the bud.
‘Watered-down policy’ of the Left 
A year ago in April 2017, the state watched in shock as the mother of Jishnu Pranoy, a boy who had allegedly committed suicide in mysterious circumstances in a private engineering college in the state, was dragged on to the streets along with her relatives because they had dared to protest in front of the DGP’s office against police inaction in the case.
The uproar was so big that even the Supreme Court citing the incident asked if the state actually had a DGP who could maintain law and order while hearing the former DGP TP Senkumar’s removal case.
Activists say that the Left government’s inability to implement its policy in the home department is the real cause of trouble which has given rise to the feeling that the police have a free hand in the state, an issue that became a hot topic in the recently concluded state conference of the CPM.
""The Left has a policy of governance which is pro-poor, pro-people. It is when that gets diluted instead of getting implemented in the most important department which is the Home, the state moves towards a police raj. The government should show spine to take stringent action against erring policemen rather than shy away from with the excuse of it affecting the morale of the force. Only that will send out the message,"" said social activist NM Pearson.
Last week a retired railway station master was punched in the face by an assistant sub-inspector for allegedly obstructing the convoy of the governor. The bleeding face of the senior citizen with a ruptured nose took the social media by storm forcing the DGP to issue a circular asking all cops on traffic duty to attend a one-day training session in civility.
Another video that got wide circulation showed Manjudas, a sub-inspector at Erattupetta in central Kerala, showering expletives on bikers.
Again in March, two bikers lost their lives after they crashed while being forcibly stopped by cops checking for helmetless driving in Alappuzha.
CN Shareef, a photojournalist of a vernacular daily was beaten up in a police station at Malappuram in north Kerala. His crime was that he had dared to click the picture of a protest billboard kept at the Areekode police station.
The list of police excesses over the last few months is an uncomfortably long one. But in spite of the DGP’s circular calling for training, it had little effect on the ground.
Even before the ink had dried another incident of police misbehaviour was reported on the same evening soon after the day’s training on behaviour was wound up.
Since the Left came to power in 2016, the state’s police force has often been on the wrong side of the law. The proof lies not just in the umpteen number of incidents of misbehaviour and unruly conduct but also in the steady rebuke that the department had been receiving from the judiciary during the same period.
There are political observers who feel that it is not the lack of a policy on the part of the government that is driving the police excesses but rather it’s a well-crafted agenda of the Left that is at the root of the issue.
""This Left government led by Pinarayi Vijayan seems to have adopted a line of resisting all dissenting voices using the state machinery. The police are a most important tool in implementing this agenda. When that happens obviously the police will also take the law into their hands and behave according to their whims and fancies. I think the present police misbehaviour is a fall out of this government’s policy of gagging any form of democratic dissent,"" CR Neelakandan, an anti-corruption activist-turned-politician with the Aam Admi Party (AAP) told Firstpost .
Lack of leadership 
Most of the top brass of the police whom Firstpost talked to were worried about the audacity with which the cops at the lower rung keep breaking the directions of the state police chief.
Despite bringing out circulars and verbal ultimatums that those found taking law into their hands would be dealt with an iron hand, there is hardly anyone who shies away from doing what they deem fit on the ground.
Retired officers say that this 'non-ownership attitude' of a few puts the entire force's reputation at stake and it is also the crux of the entire problem.
Subash Babu is a retired superintendent of police who had also spent considerable time at the Police Training College in Thrissur.
Babu says that the lack of strong leadership at the top is killing the force and that there is hardly any uniformity in the 'uniformed force' in the state at the moment.
""Police is a team work where ownership is very important. When you have a DGP at the top who hardly has a personal connect with the even the district police chiefs what else do you expect? See when a policeman does something which he very well knows will bring disrepute to his senior officer and the force, it should make him think twice before doing it. But he hardly cares because unlike our times when we used to have a personal connect with the top brass, there is hardly any such feeling nowadays. It’s a failure of the leadership to inspire,"" Babu told Firstpost .
That the current DGP Lokanath Behera had come to the seat under controversial circumstances after the state government shunted out former DGP Senkumar also hardly helped Behera’s cause in gaining the trust of his force.
Senkumar returned for a month with a Supreme Court order before retiring to pave way for Behera. But since then the new DGP has hardly been able to fit the bill of a Senkumar who was well known for his personal touch with senior and junior officers in the force.
Behera also earned the displeasure of the apex court when it openly criticised him for the way he dealt the protest of Jishnu Pranoy's mother. For over two years the DGP has hardly been a rallying point for the force is something which many see as a big drawback.
Political godfathers 
Policemen having political godfathers are nothing new. But the system in Kerala is such that the nexus between the force and the political leadership runs very deep.
Most of it becomes much evident when a cadre-based party like the CPM takes control over the reins of power. The party decides where to put which officer and once it is a political appointment even the cop knows that the politician will watch his back.
Such is the nexus between the political class and men in uniform that any disciplinary action is also met with a high amount of resistance using the politicians. It is here that Kerala Police Association (KPA) comes into the picture. Formed for protecting the welfare of policemen and women, it is now a centre of misuse claims retried senior officers. 
""It is very difficult to see that on the surface. But certainly the association is what bails out erring policemen. One suspension for a few days and soon the cop makes a re-entry through the back door and gets transferred for a new posting. All this is stage managed by the association by putting pressure on the politician who then puts pressure on the senior officer to ensure that any departmental enquiry is stalled. This is how they get away. So they have no fear at all,"" said former DGP Siby Mathews.
Babu also said that the present atmosphere in police stations across the state hardly make it a unified force.
""Almost every police station in Kerala is a divided house now. On one side you have two political groups, the CPM and the Congress right inside the station among the men. Then you have two other sets where one will be a super discipline group and the other an indifferent group. It’s an eternal power struggle between these groups which runs a police station nowadays, leaving little room for control from the top officers,"" said Babu.
Stressed force? 
The Kerala State Police Complaints Authority is the only watchdog where citizens can approach with complaints against the police. In 2015, the then chairperson of KSPCA, justice Narayana Kurup had openly said that young officers of the force need to reform themselves and not try to behave like super cops.
Kurup had even suggested to the government of the day that the 2014 batch of sub-inspectors need to be recalled for training since the authority had received innumerable complaints against them. But nothing had been done since then.
""They are not able to reconcile the newly experienced sense of authority to the reality of citizens' rights. That is the major problem. You can only change this by reinforcing on them the idea that citizens are not here to live by your command but you are here to help the citizens in need. The policemen need to understand authority in the context of protection and not power,"" said former DGP Jacob Punnose. 
But psychologists said that stress plays a crucial role and it is easy to blame the policeman for his behaviour.
""Displaced aggression is a common phenomenon here . Take the instance of road rage shown by traffic policemen. Here is a man who is under pressure from his superiors, working under poor conditions, facing disparity in pay for the kind of work he does. It doesn’t take much for him to lose his cool. What is needed is a scientific approach to recruitment as well as training. You need to equip him to meet the challenge,"" said psychologist KS David.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. On 28 March, the Supreme Court rejected a review petition filed by the state government to invalidate cancellations of the admissions in these two colleges as per a 2016 Kerala high court order. Photo: PTI Bengaluru: The Kerala assembly on Wednesday approved a bill to regularize MBBS admissions, which had previously been deemed illegal by two official panels, apart from the Medical Council of India. 
The Kerala Professional Colleges (Regulation and Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill 2017 will benefit about 180 students of two colleges—Kannur medical college and Karuna Medical College. 
Both are private colleges based in Kannur and Palakkad districts, respectively. The students had secured admissions in the 2016-17 batch. 
The passing of the bill comes a week after the Supreme Court asked the state government to stay the ordinance, which paved the way for the current bill. 
The ordinance has been challenged by the Medical Council of India in the Supreme Court. 
The matter is expected to come up for hearing again on Thursday. 
On 28 March, the Supreme Court rejected a review petition filed by the state government to invalidate cancellations of the admissions in these two colleges as per a 2016 Kerala high court order. 
The high court had found that the colleges were not transparent about their admission procedures and cited the scuttling of chances of meritorious students in favour of those who were not as the grounds for the cancelling admissions. 
The state government, however, got near unanimous support in the state assembly on Wednesday to pass the bill, reported regional news channels. 
Congress member V.T. Balram’s protests against the bill were overruled by a leader from his own party, Ramesh Chennithala. 
Last week, both chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister K.K. Shylaja, who oversees the admission process, said the logic behind the bill was humanitarian considerations to save the academic life of innocent students penalized for probable technical errors of the management. 
“There is no connivance between the government and Opposition. There are no glitches in the bill. The bill is not for protecting vested interests,” Chennithala was cited as saying by the website of regional newspaper Mathrubhumi. 
The admissions were first set aside in October 2016 by an official panel headed by retired Justice J.M. James. 
On 27 March, newspaper Deccan Chronicle reported that another official, who was tasked with advising on whether to regularize the disputed seats had recommended against the regularization. 
Based on documents obtained using Right to Information, the newspaper report said that the official’s findings included profiteering in the seats by these colleges, which is illegal in India. 
The government then asked the law department to take a look at the situation, which came up with a report favouring regularization. 
The government decided to follow the legal opinion of the law department. 
On 31 January, the state cabinet agreed to regularizing the seats in the two colleges after fining them at a rate of Rs3 lakh per student for irregularities in the admission process. First Published: Wed, Apr 04 2018. 11 13 PM IST",english

The case was registered against Mohammed Aziz, Praveen M P and Sharat Damodaran, all second year students of the Nehru college, on the basis of a written complaint by the Principal P V Pushapaja. Members of the pro CPI(M) Students Federation of India (SFI) had burst crackers, rejoicing at her retirement and humiliated her by paying her 'homage' last week by putting up a poster offering 'condolences' to a teacher ""who had died in the hearts of students."" The Principal, who went personally to the police station to lodge her complaint, sought action against the students who had caused her 'mental agony' and 'insulted' her by their action, police said. Taking a serious view of the incident, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had informed the state assembly that strong action would be taken against the students. ""The students should consider teachers as their mothers and that is our culture. Insulting a teacher cannot be tolerated"", Vijayan had said. Two students have been suspended in connection with the incident,which came to the limelight after a video of students bursting crackers and putting up the condolence message at the auditorium of the college campus went viral on the social media. The incident had also triggered widespread condemnation from different quarters. Last year, SFI students had set on fire the chair of the Maharaja's College Principal, N L Beena, in Kochi, during a strike by the teachers union. In 2016, some students of Government Victoria College , Palakkad, had built a symbolic grave for their outgoing principal, Dr T N Sarasu.",english

For eighty-eight students from various schools across the State, this summer provides a unique opportunity to explore Kerala’s culture, over one week, moving from place to place. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday flagged off the ‘Cultural study tour’ organised by the Department of Culture. 
Two batches of students set off from both ends of the State, Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod, towards Thrissur. 
To introduce the students to varied cultures, the students from the southern districts up to Thrissur started their journey from Kasaragod, while those from the northern districts began their journey from Thiruvananthapuram. 
“The students will visit various cultural institutions in each of the districts that they will be passing through. They will take part in various programmes there. Demonstrations of art forms will be given. They will travel from both sides of the State towards Thrissur, remembering our great renaissance leaders. 
It is for the first time that the students of the State are getting such an opportunity,” said Minister for Culture A.K.Balan. 
Student selection 
Though the study tour is being organised by the Bharat Bhavan under the Culture Department, the selection of the students was done by the Education Department. 
From the students who wrote the USS scholarship, the top 20 from each educational district were selected for the gifted children programme. 
From them, six from each district were chosen for a State-level talent meet. 
All the students who took part in the talent meet are part of the study tour now. The study tours from both ends of the State will converge at the Sahithya Akademi Hall in Thrissur on April 10.",english

In a studio based in Kerala, marriage videos had been converted into porn videos. This crime has taken place in Kozhikode based Sathyam Shoot and Edit studio, located in Vadakara. This studio has been in existence for the past 5 years. The workers of the studio had worked in more than 1000 weddings and have photographed and video graphed many events. 

However, it has been found that they have misused the photos and videos in a wrong manner. In recent times, it has become popular trend to have special photo shoots for weddings like Pre wedding and Post wedding photo shoots, and in case of kids’ birthdays, baby shoots, etc, and Sathyam Edit and Shoot Studio is one such studio having expertise in such shoots. It has been recently found that the studio people have edited and misused marriage videos, and faces, in obscene porn videos, and had even misused photos of babies. 

Following a complaint by a couple in Kerala, two main culprits involved, Satheeshan and Dineshan were arrested, and it has been found that these two were the ones who own the studio, and yet another accused, Bipish has been absconding.

“Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will launch the steel boat with rescue and medical equipment at Panavally near Aroor on Monday next, catering to hundreds of residents in Perumbalam Island in Vembanad lake. The islanders have no road connectivity and during emergencies like disease or mishap, the boat will be at their service,” said a senior SWTD official.
Four more similar boats will be soon deployed at Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Kottayam.
“Currently we lack a dedicated rescue mechanism like a boat with rescue and medical equipment. The vessels are meant for rescue purposes upon any emergency in the water bodies. A dedicated mobile number will be publicized and the boat would be rushed to the spot upon getting alerts. They will also serve the purpose of water ambulance for people living on islands in Alappuzha and Ernakulam area with no road connectivity,” the official said.
Each of the 40-foot vessels can accommodate 16 passengers and three crew. It has a design speed of 12 knots instead of the normal boat speed of seven. The boats will have all basic equipment besides medical facilities for first aid. Kochi-based Navgathi Marine Design and Constructions (P) Ltd is constructing the boats which would cost nearly Rs five crore.
“Out of the remaining four ambulance boats, construction of two has reached finishing stage. A high-level meet is scheduled on Thursday to finalise the services and the exact places of deployment,” he said.",english

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that steps would be taken to reduce the time taken to settle a file. He, however, said that checks at various levels of bureaucracy were important for efficient and error-free administration.
“Files are handled in Secretariat mainly on the basis of Secretariat Office Manual and Rules of Business,” the Chief Minister said in response to a Submission raised by CPM MLA K.V. Vijayadas in the Assembly on Wednesday.
“The orders and directives issued on the basis of government decisions should be exhaustive and factual. Deep and thorough examination is required before taking a decision on important policy matters,” the Chief Minister said.
He said that there were basic rules governing the structure of official orders, the framing of rules, legislation, and fund utilisation. “Issuing orders and circulars without errors and in the proper way is crucial for efficient administration. This is why the Secretariat Office Manual mandates scrutiny at different levels,” Mr Vijayan said. Nonetheless, he said that bureaucratic checks had been avoided wherever possible. Still, he conceded that certain shortcomings persisted.
“We have tried to reduce the time taken on a file through the optimium and efficient application of technology. E-office system has more or less been completed in Secretariat. Link officer mechanism, too, has been put in place to make sure that file movement is not restricted by the absence or non-availability of officials,” the Chief Minister said. The financial powers of officials too are revised in a timely manner, he said.",english

The CM also informed that 170 PHCs in the state will be converted to Family Health Centres with better facilities and adequate staff while inaugurating a seminar organised by KSHRC. Recalling the recent incidence in the state when a seriously injured patient was held upside down in a stretcher by ambulance staff, chief minister said the incidence underscores the need for training ambulance staff in patient care. It was a proud moment to know that Kerala has bagged the first place in health care sector according NITI Aayog with the rating at 76.55 percent, yet there are lapses in terms of high rate of accidental deaths in the state and lapses in medical treatment which needs to be checked. ""The primary health centres (PHCs) in the state will be improved ensuring better facilities and staff. The 170 PHCs in the state will be transformed to Family Health Centres (FHCs) with all facilities and creating 4800 new posts. FHCs will be equipped with adequate facilities and doctors to address the health issues of each family,"" he said. Based on complaints from patients against some private hospitals, KSHRC had directed to install CCTV cameras in ICUs at private hospitals to check lapses in treatment and it has to be examined. In case of patients with grievances over medical negligence, when they appeal to the Medical Board, the Board should take an unbiased stance instead of supporting the medical fraternity. The accused doctors can go for appeal again while the patient has no way to appeal to a higher authority. Upright civil servants who had made it to the service after their graduation in medicine should head such a Board and it should ensure justice to the affected patient to function in an unbiased manner for its credibility, he said. In case of mercy killing of terminally ill, though the Supreme Court has issued a favourable verdict, the Parliament has to ensure that its implementation is not misused and for that the government has to ensure a proper system in place, he said. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the nexus between corporate hospitals and drug mafia has left health care in the lurch. “Even now majority of the patients hold the doctor’s word sacred and when that trust is lost it will affect the entire health sector. Human rights violations in health care sector are hardly addressed in the state. Every human being irrespective of economic status should be offered the best health care and that is the right of every individual which needs to be ensured. Currently, the poor cannot afford the treatment at super speciality hospitals and that needs to change, he said. He also called to ensure that the Parliament Bill on Mercy Killing should be verified for its legal clauses to prevent misuse before its introduction. KSHRC acting chairperson and former judge Justice P Mohandas sad most of the complaints received from patients on HR violations is against the hospitals, doctors and police personnel. The HR violations in health care of tribal community is also a major lapse that needs to be addressed, he said. – TOI",english

The Supreme Court on Thursday rapped the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government for promulgating an ordinance to “blatantly nullify” last year’s apex court order freezing illegal medical admissions made in the State. 
Staying the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance of 2017, a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit passed a scathing order, accusing the government of trying to bulldoze the court. 
“In our prima facie view, the ordinance in question blatantly seeks to nullify the binding effect of the order passed by this court. Prima facie it was not open to declare this court’s order as void or ineffective as was sought to be done by way of ordinance,” the Supreme Court observed in its order. 
“We, therefore, stay the operation of the ordinance and make it clear that no student shall be permitted to reap any benefit of any action taken and they shall not be permitted to attend the college or the classes or continue in medical colleges in any manner pursuant to the ordinance,” the Supreme Court ordered. 
It warned that any violation of the order “shall be treated seriously by this court.” 
On March 22 last year, the apex court cancelled the admission of 180 medical undergraduate students in Kannur Medical College and Karuna Medical College in Kerala owing to irregularities in admission procedure. 
The apex court had ordered the termination of 150 admissions in Kannur Medical College and 30 in Karuna Medical College, thus sending a strong message to private professional colleges that there would be zero tolerance if irregularities were found in admissions even at the cost of derailing the academic future of the students involved. 
The State government reacted by promulgating the ordinance on October 20, 2017, in order to regularise the 180 admissions. This was followed up with the State Assembly unanimously passing a Bill on April 4, 2018, to replace the ordinance. 
Challenging the ordinance, the Medical Council of India (MCI), meanwhile, approached the Supreme Court. 
The MCI, represented by senior advocate Vikas Singh and advocate Gaurav Sharma, argued that the ordinance negates the principle of equality and equal protection of laws in as much as there would be no difference in illegal admissions made by the two colleges and other admissions made in accordance with law. 
The MCI submitted that regularising illegal medical admissions, if allowed, would have severe repercussions as private medical colleges would get impetus to admit students without following proper procedure. 
The medical body, seeking an immediate stay of the ordinance, said “the legislature in exercise of its legislative powers cannot strike down any judgment/decision passed by the constitutional courts.” 
Agreeing, the Supreme Court said it was not prima facie open for the State to “sit over the judgment and validate those very admissions and to venture into regularising them.” 
The court posted the case for hearing in the second week of May.",english

“We therefore, stay the operation of the ordinance and make it clear that no student shall be permitted to reap any benefit of any action taken and they shall not be permitted to attend the college or the classes or continue in medical colleges in any manner pursuant to ordinance,” the Supreme Court ordered. 
It warned that that any violation of the order “shall be treated seriously by this court” 
On March 22 last year, the apex court cancelled the admission of 180 medical undergraduate students to Kannur Medical College and Karuna Medical College in Kerala owing to irregularities in admission procedure. Termination of 150 admissions 
The apex court had ordered the termination of 150 admissions in Kannur Medical College and 30 in Karuna Medical College, thus sending a strong message to private professional colleges that there would be zero tolerance if irregularities were found in admissions even at the cost of de-railing the academic future of the students involved. 
The State government reacted by promulgating the ordinance on October 20, 2017 in order to regularise the 180 admissions. This was followed up with the State Assembly unanimously passing a Bill on April 4, 2018 to replace the ordinance. 
Challenging the ordinance, the Medical Council of India meanwhile approached the Supreme Court. 
The Council, represented by senior advocate Vikas Singh and advocate Gaurav Sharma, argued that the ordinance negates the principle of equality and equal protection of laws in as much as there would be no difference in illegal admissions made by the two colleges and other admissions made in accordance with law. 
The Council submitted that regularising illegal medical admissions, if allowed, would have severe repercussions as private medical colleges would get impetus to admit students without following proper procedure. 
The medical body, seeking an immediate stay of the ordinance, said that “the Legislature in exercise of its legislative powers cannot strike down any judgment /decision passed by the constitutional courts”. 
Agreeing, the Supreme Court said it was not prima facie open for the State to “sit over the judgment and validate those very admissions and to venture into regularising them”. 
The court posted the case for hearing in the second week of May.",english

Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 5 (PTI) Kerala government has entrusted the state run Keltron to set up a Special Purpose Vehicle for starting electronic industries in the state. A decision in this regard was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here yesterday, an official release said here today. The Intel Corporation, the manufactures of semi-conductor and micro processor has agreed to co-operative in the venture, the release said. It was planned to develop laptops and processors using Intel processor, it was stated. The venture was expected to provide a new thrust to the electronic industries in the state, the release added. The new company was planned based on the report of the Kerala Electronics and Hardware Mission. The mission had submitted a detailed report in August this year outlining the potential, challenges and road map for electronics system design and manufacturing and promotion of the States startup ecosystem. The Mission was set up after Kerala government singed an MOU with Intel and UST Global for exploring the possibility of transforming the state into an electronic hardware manufacturing hub.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the government does not want any conflict with the courts on the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill. 
“The government has not set out on a contest with the courts. That is the first thing that I wish to clarify. What has happened here is this: the future of several students was in jeopardy and everyone began exerting pressure on the government to take steps to protect the interests of the students,” the Chief Minister said in Kochi on Thursday, while explaining the rationale of the Bill passed by the Kerala Assembly on Wednesday. 
Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said all that the government had done was to introduce a Bill to replace the ordinance promulgated to save the students from a major predicament. “I had told the students when they approached me that they would do well to look out for other options and that they would lose five years if the court were to decide against them after five years,” she pointed out. 
The legal issues involved in the Supreme Court verdict and the question whether the Bill would stand the scrutiny of law now that the Supreme Court has rejected the ordinance which it sought to replace would have to be studied in detail. Only legal experts would be able to say that, she added. 
Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan said he had signed the Bill adopted by the Assembly on Wednesday and forwarded it to the government to be forwarded to Governor P. Sathasivam. 
‘Verdict preconceived’ 
Meanwhile, CPI (M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the Supreme Court verdict nullifying the admission of 180 students was preconceived. 
Speaking to reporters in Alappuzha on Thursday, he said: “The Supreme Court has not considered the good intention of the State government on the matter.”",english

The Supreme Court verdict came on an appeal by the Medical Council of India against regularisation of these admissions made in two self-financing Kannur and Karuna medical colleges in 2016-17. 
The Kerala government was directed to see to it that all 180 admissions were cancelled and there was no attempt to disobey the apex court directive. 
Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the entire opposition voted for the bill because of concern over the future of the students. 
Calling the apex court ruling “most unfortunate”, Communist Party of India-Marxist State Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said “the government had only the future of these students in mind.” Former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy 
The state had decided to replace the ordinance to regularise these admissions with the new bill. The apex court pointed out that it was yet to become a law as the Governor had not given his assent. 
Former State Congress President V.M. Sudheeran flayed the Congress-led opposition for voting in favour of the bill. “This shows all protests by the opposition against exploitation by self-financing institutions’ managements is nothing but hoax,” he said. 
Affected students said they were at a loss of words since their future appeared bleak. 
“We really do not know what wrong we did to suffer like this. We did not even have a counsel to represent us,” said one of them.

The state's police force which comes under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has been caught misbehaving with the common man on the street at an alarming frequency over the last one month. In the last few weeks alone more than half a dozen such cases where the men in uniform abuse, harass and even beat up unsuspecting citizens have been reported from across the state.
With the opposition led by the Congress party raising the issue in the state Assembly and even staging a walkout following a decline by the Speaker to move an adjournment motion on the issue last week, the government had to openly admit the error and call for corrective steps.

""We are acknowledging the situation and let me assure everyone that strict action will be taken against those found to be misbehaving with the general public. The department will be a calling a special meeting to address the issue at the earliest,"" Director General of Police (DGP) Lokanath Behera told media persons this week.
But not everyone is ready to buy the words of the DGP and there is a clear-cut reason for that. In the last two years alone many such situations have come about when the men in uniform have been found wanting when it comes to public behaviour and the state police chief and the department had hardly moved a finger to nip such attempts in the bud.
'Watered-down policy' of the Left
A year ago in April 2017, the state watched in shock as the mother of Jishnu Pranoy, a boy who had allegedly committed suicide in mysterious circumstances in a private engineering college in the state, was dragged on to the streets along with her relatives because they had dared to protest in front of the DGP's office against police inaction in the case.
The uproar was so big that even the Supreme Court citing the incident asked if the state actually had a DGP who could maintain law and order while hearing the former DGP TP Senkumar's removal case.
Activists say that the Left government's inability to implement its policy in the home department is the real cause of trouble which has given rise to the feeling that the police have a free hand in the state, an issue that became a hot topic in the recently concluded state conference of the CPM.
""The Left has a policy of governance which is pro-poor, pro-people. It is when that gets diluted instead of getting implemented in the most important department which is the Home, the state moves towards a police raj. The government should show spine to take stringent action against erring policemen rather than shy away from with the excuse of it affecting the morale of the force. Only that will send out the message,"" said social activist NM Pearson.
Last week a retired railway station master was punched in the face by an assistant sub-inspector for allegedly obstructing the convoy of the governor. The bleeding face of the senior citizen with a ruptured nose took the social media by storm forcing the DGP to issue a circular asking all cops on traffic duty to attend a one-day training session in civility.
Another video that got wide circulation showed Manjudas, a sub-inspector at Erattupetta in central Kerala, showering expletives on bikers.
Again in March, two bikers lost their lives after they crashed while being forcibly stopped by cops checking for helmetless driving in Alappuzha.
CN Shareef, a photojournalist of a vernacular daily was beaten up in a police station at Malappuram in north Kerala. His crime was that he had dared to click the picture of a protest billboard kept at the Areekode police station.
The list of police excesses over the last few months is an uncomfortably long one. But in spite of the DGP's circular calling for training, it had little effect on the ground.
Even before the ink had dried another incident of police misbehaviour was reported on the same evening soon after the day's training on behaviour was wound up.
Story Continues Since the Left came to power in 2016, the state's police force has often been on the wrong side of the law. The proof lies not just in the umpteen number of incidents of misbehaviour and unruly conduct but also in the steady rebuke that the department had been receiving from the judiciary during the same period.
There are political observers who feel that it is not the lack of a policy on the part of the government that is driving the police excesses but rather it's a well-crafted agenda of the Left that is at the root of the issue.
""This Left government led by Pinarayi Vijayan seems to have adopted a line of resisting all dissenting voices using the state machinery. The police are a most important tool in implementing this agenda. When that happens obviously the police will also take the law into their hands and behave according to their whims and fancies. I think the present police misbehaviour is a fall out of this government's policy of gagging any form of democratic dissent,"" CR Neelakandan, an anti-corruption activist-turned-politician with the Aam Admi Party (AAP) told Firstpost .
Lack of leadership
Most of the top brass of the police whom Firstpost talked to were worried about the audacity with which the cops at the lower rung keep breaking the directions of the state police chief.
Despite bringing out circulars and verbal ultimatums that those found taking law into their hands would be dealt with an iron hand, there is hardly anyone who shies away from doing what they deem fit on the ground.
Retired officers say that this 'non-ownership attitude' of a few puts the entire force's reputation at stake and it is also the crux of the entire problem.
Subash Babu is a retired superintendent of police who had also spent considerable time at the Police Training College in Thrissur.
Babu says that the lack of strong leadership at the top is killing the force and that there is hardly any uniformity in the 'uniformed force' in the state at the moment.
""Police is a team work where ownership is very important. When you have a DGP at the top who hardly has a personal connect with the even the district police chiefs what else do you expect? See when a policeman does something which he very well knows will bring disrepute to his senior officer and the force, it should make him think twice before doing it. But he hardly cares because unlike our times when we used to have a personal connect with the top brass, there is hardly any such feeling nowadays. It's a failure of the leadership to inspire,"" Babu told Firstpost .
That the current DGP Lokanath Behera had come to the seat under controversial circumstances after the state government shunted out former DGP Senkumar also hardly helped Behera's cause in gaining the trust of his force.
Senkumar returned for a month with a Supreme Court order before retiring to pave way for Behera. But since then the new DGP has hardly been able to fit the bill of a Senkumar who was well known for his personal touch with senior and junior officers in the force.
Behera also earned the displeasure of the apex court when it openly criticised him for the way he dealt the protest of Jishnu Pranoy's mother. For over two years the DGP has hardly been a rallying point for the force is something which many see as a big drawback.
Political godfathers
Policemen having political godfathers are nothing new. But the system in Kerala is such that the nexus between the force and the political leadership runs very deep.
Most of it becomes much evident when a cadre-based party like the CPM takes control over the reins of power. The party decides where to put which officer and once it is a political appointment even the cop knows that the politician will watch his back.
Such is the nexus between the political class and men in uniform that any disciplinary action is also met with a high amount of resistance using the politicians. It is here that Kerala Police Association (KPA) comes into the picture. Formed for protecting the welfare of policemen and women, it is now a centre of misuse claims retried senior officers.
""It is very difficult to see that on the surface. But certainly the association is what bails out erring policemen. One suspension for a few days and soon the cop makes a re-entry through the back door and gets transferred for a new posting. All this is stage managed by the association by putting pressure on the politician who then puts pressure on the senior officer to ensure that any departmental enquiry is stalled. This is how they get away. So they have no fear at all,"" said former DGP Siby Mathews.
Babu also said that the present atmosphere in police stations across the state hardly make it a unified force.
""Almost every police station in Kerala is a divided house now. On one side you have two political groups, the CPM and the Congress right inside the station among the men. Then you have two other sets where one will be a super discipline group and the other an indifferent group. It's an eternal power struggle between these groups which runs a police station nowadays, leaving little room for control from the top officers,"" said Babu.
Stressed force?
The Kerala State Police Complaints Authority is the only watchdog where citizens can approach with complaints against the police. In 2015, the then chairperson of KSPCA, justice Narayana Kurup had openly said that young officers of the force need to reform themselves and not try to behave like super cops.
Kurup had even suggested to the government of the day that the 2014 batch of sub-inspectors need to be recalled for training since the authority had received innumerable complaints against them. But nothing had been done since then.
""They are not able to reconcile the newly experienced sense of authority to the reality of citizens' rights. That is the major problem. You can only change this by reinforcing on them the idea that citizens are not here to live by your command but you are here to help the citizens in need. The policemen need to understand authority in the context of protection and not power,"" said former DGP Jacob Punnose.
But psychologists said that stress plays a crucial role and it is easy to blame the policeman for his behaviour.
""Displaced aggression is a common phenomenon here. Take the instance of road rage shown by traffic policemen. Here is a man who is under pressure from his superiors, working under poor conditions, facing disparity in pay for the kind of work he does. It doesn't take much for him to lose his cool. What is needed is a scientific approach to recruitment as well as training. You need to equip him to meet the challenge,"" said psychologist KS David.

In its professional approach, the Ernakulam General Hospital has become a model for all government-run hospitals, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
Mr. Vijayan’s praise for the hospital came after he inaugurated the functioning of a linear accelerator and the construction of a super-speciality block, cancer block, and an 11kv sub-station on a cumulative budget of ₹76 crore raised through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). He also handed over the NABH certificate to the hospital. 
Linear accelerator is an advanced equipment used in cancer treatment, a novel capability in a hospital under the Department of Health Services. The social commitment and joint effort by the hospital staff led to the installation of the equipment here, Mr. Vijayan said, adding that the government intended to comprehensively develop the health sector with the upgrade of all medical colleges. 
District and taluk hospitals are equipped with super-speciality facilities. There was criticism that funds would not come from KIIFB. “But the General Hospital has proved that funds will be available if the technical specifications are adhered to accurately and in time. It was able to give the project blueprint on time,” he said. 
Mr. Vijayan added that the government was making strong interventions to empower primary health centres with a view to protecting public health. 
Health Minister K.K. Shylaja also said that over the past two years, taluk hospitals, district hospitals, and medical colleges had witnessed comprehensive development activities. Primary health centres, which were lying idle, received a fresh lease of life under the new government. Cath lab facility was made available in eight districts. Projects were implemented using government funds and CSR funds of companies. All medical colleges are being equipped with mini-RCCs for cancer treatment, she said. 
The linear accelerator was set up with the support of eight parliamentarians led by P. Rajeev, CPI(M) district secretary and former Rajya Sabha member. Further help was extended by various companies and social organisations. 
The hospital is in receipt of NABH accreditation for the third time – a unique achievement among government hospitals. District Collector K. Mohammed Y. Safirulla said piling was almost complete for the new block at the hospital. Its construction will be over in 560 days. The super-speciality block, with an air-conditioned area of 77,000 sq ft, will be made operational in two years.",english

Because contrary to what the likes of Mamata must be hoping for, history tells us that a ‘third-front’ without the backing of a national party, Congress, in this case, has only trodden on choppy waters before eventually drowning in the political slugfest. While Mamata has very cleverly remained non-committal on the proposal to keep Congress out of the anti-BJP platform, other regional leaders like Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Kerala chief minister and veteran CPM leader Pinarayi Vijayan have made it clear that they do not want Congress to be a part of the next political alternative they plan to offer to the country. “Regional parties are strong these days. Regional tie-ups can be considered during elections for a real political alternative. There is no point in joining hands with one particular party at the national level,” Vijayan told PTI . 
Congress president Rahul Gandhi with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. PTI More Congress president Rahul Gandhi with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. PTI As of now, Mamata has been the most active in meeting various state leaders and ministers including Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and disgruntled BJP members like Shatrughan Sinha, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie. However, she has termed KCR’s alternative as the “people’s front of India” and extended support to him as well. “ Ham aap se sahmat hai. Aap ke saath rahenge” (I am in agreement with you. I will work with you), Banerjee was quoted as saying in response to KCR’s call for a qualitative change in the national political narrative. Meanwhile though, Yashwant Sinha did not clarify on whether he or Shatrughan Sinha would join a united force against the BJP. He instead said , “Mamata is our old cabinet colleague. Her personality is known to everyone. The role she has taken to save the country is appreciable. In future also, we will support her.” Despite her positioning, Mamata, however, has still kept her cards close to her chest as she met former Congress president Sonia Gandhi but has maintained a marked distance from the current Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. On the other hand, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar who is known to be a close ally fo the Congress, has advised the Opposition to shed the anti-Congress tag if it is to fight ably fight the BJP. “The Congress is required for the country. It cannot be bypassed. Even in its weakened state, it alone has the pan-Indian reach other parties lack,” he has been quoted as saying. However, he was quick to add that the Congress, for its part, should also acknowledge the strength of regional players and be ready for a compromise, if needed. His reference was to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, where the Congress tried to set foot beyond its electoral reach. For example, in the recent by-polls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, it set up candidates against the SP-BSP combine. The NCP, on the other hand, has decided against fielding “unnecessary” candidates that will weaken the anti-BJP challenge in the upcoming Assembly elections in Karnataka on 12 May. So, even though the Opposition might see BJP’s loss in the Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha by-polls to the alliance of Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party as a chance of comeback for the state-grown parties, it is the internal friction and the lack of a unanimously chosen leader which may cost the ‘third-front’ another election. For instance, in 1996, a group of regional parties and the Left formed the United Front government. This front too was formed with the primary objective of keeping the BJP out of power. The Congress supported the coalition from outside. In a recent interview, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury indicated that the country may see a 1996 type situation once again. However, the draft political resolution adopted at CPM’s Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress. 
Story Continues A hung Parliament emerged from the 1996 elections in which the Congress government of PV Narasimha Rao was defeated. The BJP became the largest party in Parliament with 161 MPs and formed a government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee but this only lasted 13 days. Regional and Left leaders came together and offered the leadership to former prime minister VP Singh, who declined it. They then turned to CPM veteran Jyoti Basu, but he too declined the offer, a decision he would later go on to describe as a “historic blunder”. Finally, the baton was passed to Janata Dal’s HD Deve Gowda but even after having the support of the Left Front and Congress, the Deve Gowda government couldn’t last beyond a year. Post this, Inder Kumar Gujral came to the fore but even under his leadership, the government did not complete its full term due to constant internal squabble and a volatile relationship with Congress. Finally, the country went to polls again in 1998a and the BJP came to power. The fragile nature of the Third Front became a powerful poll plank for the BJP. Its 1998 government lasted only 13 months, but in 1999, it returned to power and was able to form the first stable National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government that ran a full course. The BJP, which had earlier been snubbed because of its strong Hindutva agenda, gained the confidence of allies. This episode also led to the formation of more stable coalition governments in the future. Both the NDA and the two Congress-led UPA governments that followed, remained stable because regional parties did not want frequent elections. The experiment also showed the importance of a larger, national party being the anchor of a coalition. It marked the consolidation and subsequently rather quick fragmentation of regional parties. The Janata Dal, which promised to be an alternative to the national parties, got reduced to a fallacious political figment and all its various constituents drifted apart. Coming back to the current scenario, the latest entrant to the upcoming third front is NDA’s estranged partner, N Chandrababu Naidu, whose Telegu Desam Party had moved a no-confidence motion against the Centre. But even Naidu has fewer friends in the political circle than he would like. The YSR Congress suspects that Naidu came to Delhi to look for a new alliance partner. “That he is coming to Delhi to fight for the interests of the state is a humbug. Now that he has become isolated in state politics, he is trying for support from other parties,” YSRC Rajya Sabha member V Vijaya Sai Reddy was quoted as telling Hindustan Times . Jana Sena Party founder-president Pawan Kalyan also termed Naidu’s visit as a “political ploy” of TDP, accusing the chief minister of lacking a “strong will and commitment”. The Left parties also believe that Naidu’s party is to be equally blamed along with the BJP for the injustice done to Andhra Pradesh after its bifurcation and hence, they did not support Naidu’s resolution at their meeting with him. In the Hindi heartland, however, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav is sounding confident after the by-poll victory and wishes to continue the alliance with BSP. He had admitted that this alliance will be only be limited to Uttar Pradesh, thus, rendering his party bereft of any possible national appeal. Akhilesh too has acknowledged Mamata’s attempts to set up a ‘federal front. But Congress doesn’t seem convinced of her plans. West Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury took a dig at Banerjee’s proposal of putting up a “one-to-one” fight against the BJP and shot back saying that the Congress did not need any advice from her. Chowdhury claimed that Banerjee was trying to project herself as a ‘pan-India leader’. “She is advising the Congress on what to do and what not to. Who has appointed her as an adviser to the Congress? If you are serious about fighting the communal forces, you have to fight under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. Anti-BJP front will succeed only under Rahul’s leadership,” he said, according to PTI . This mud-slinging has made the BJP leaders in Bengal happy. “The people of India have seen enough of such political gimmicks and they are tired of it. Such attempts are a futile exercise to satisfy their ego and greed for power. The more they do such things the public support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi will increase,” said Rahul Sinha, BJP’s national secretary and former president of the state unit. It is interesting to note here that the Left under the leadership of CPM leader Prakash Karat too had tried for a similar non-BJP, non-Congress front but had failed miserably. The Congress on its part is taking things as they come. “The battle for 2019 will be to preserve the founding vision of India. All people and forces who believe in this inclusive policy and idea of India have to come together and defeat the incumbent government. The objective is not about who will take the leadership position,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told Hindustan Times . Excluding the Congress completely may not be the most astute of strategies for the Third Front if they actually dare to conquer the BJP in the next Lok Sabha elections. The absence of a personality like Narendra Modi in the third front camp, at least for now, only makes the task even harder. After all these meetings in different parts of the country, the Third Front won’t really love to see a third-rate performance going ahead in the next general elections. For now, here’s hoping that all the power contenders keep their best ‘front’ forward. ",english

By: FE Bureau | Thiruvananthapuram | Published: April 6, 2018 3:59 AM The newly passed Bills make any new entrepreneur, who applies for an industrial licence in Kerala, legally qualified as a licence-holder for five years, if the reply is delayed beyond 30 days of application. 
The Left government in Kerala has passed two industry-friendly legislations at one go this week. The newly passed Bills make any new entrepreneur, who applies for an industrial licence in Kerala, legally qualified as a licence-holder for five years, if the reply is delayed beyond 30 days of application. However, while trimming the red tape for industrial licence, the Assembly has been cautious about giving the enactment a green edge. Ample debate rang out over the clause that spells out that the industrial outfits will not need any licence to draw out groundwater for their usage. The amendment that was approved in the Bill affirms that the industrial outfit which draws out groundwater for its use will have to take licence for purifying and recycling the water thus used. “The two Bills, Kerala Investment Promotion and Facilitation Bill 2018 and Kerala Investment Promotion and Facilitation (No. 2) Bill, 2018, would push the state’s industrial promotion initiatives in coming months,” said state industry minister AC Moideen. However, on the argument of trade union leaders, the clause saying that the industrialist could draw from his choice of workers to load and unload goods was dropped. Instead, the new law warrants that for those tasks that need mechanical support or special skills, the entrepreneur can draw from his own pool or workers. The industrial licence will be valid for five years. Earlier, the validity was for one year. Besides simplifying the procedures for licences, one reason for introducing the Bill was to end the notorious practice of headload-workers in Kerala, demanding gawking charges (locally known as nokkukooli) from the employers. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier said that the nokkukooli practice will not be allowed from May 1.

The Supreme Court Thursday stayed a Kerala ordinance regularising the admission of 180 students to two medical colleges, saying that it “seeks to nullify” its earlier order cancelling the admissions. 
Pulling up the government for promulgating the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance, 2017, a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit said, “in our prima facie view, the ordinance in question blatantly seeks to nullify the binding effect of the order passed by this court”. The court was referring to its March 22 order cancelling admission of 30 students to Karuna Medical College and 150 students to Kannur Medical College, respectively. 
The latest apex court order comes as a setback to the state government, which had got the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill, 2018, passed in the Assembly on Wednesday. This fact was brought to the notice of the Supreme Court, which said that since the Bill was not yet signed by the governor and notified, the ordinance remained alive. 
The court was hearing a petition filed by Medical Council of India challenging the ordinance. “… We rendered the decision after considering that admissions were not given to the students in accordance with law and approved the decision of regulatory committee effective,” the bench said. “Thus, it was prima facie not open to sit over the judgment and validate those very admissions and to venture into regularising them.” 
On Wednesday, when the Bill came up in the Assembly, the Congress-led opposition had backed it. After the verdict, CM Pinarayi Vijayan told the media in Kochi that the government would decide on the future course after discussions. He said,“The government went ahead with the Bill to protect the interest of the students.” Congress leader V M Sudheeran said his party MLAs were wrong in supporting the Bill.

Despite her positioning, Mamata, however, has still kept her cards close to her chest as she met former Congress president Sonia Gandhi but has maintained a marked distance from the current Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.
On the other hand, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar who is known to be a close ally fo the Congress, has advised the Opposition to shed the anti-Congress tag if it is to fight ably fight the BJP. ""The Congress is required for the country. It cannot be bypassed. Even in its weakened state, it alone has the pan-Indian reach other parties lack,"" he has been quoted as saying. However, he was quick to add that the Congress, for its part, should also acknowledge the strength of regional players and be ready for a compromise, if needed.
His reference was to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, where the Congress tried to set foot beyond its electoral reach. For example, in the recent by-polls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, it set up candidates against the SP-BSP combine. The NCP, on the other hand, has decided against fielding ""unnecessary"" candidates that will weaken the anti-BJP challenge in the upcoming Assembly elections in Karnataka on 12 May.
So, even though the Opposition might see BJP's loss in the Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha by-polls to the alliance of Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party as a chance of comeback for the state-grown parties, it is the internal friction and the lack of a unanimously chosen leader which may cost the 'third-front' another election.
For instance, in 1996, a group of regional parties and the Left formed the United Front government. This front too was formed with the primary objective of keeping the BJP out of power. The Congress supported the coalition from outside. In a recent interview, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury indicated that the country may see a 1996 type situation once again. However, the draft political resolution adopted at CPM's Central Committee meeting in Kolkata in January this year had ruled out any electoral alliance or understanding with the Congress.
Story Continues A hung Parliament emerged from the 1996 elections in which the Congress government of PV Narasimha Rao was defeated. The BJP became the largest party in Parliament with 161 MPs and formed a government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee but this only lasted 13 days. Regional and Left leaders came together and offered the leadership to former prime minister VP Singh, who declined it. They then turned to CPM veteran Jyoti Basu, but he too declined the offer, a decision he would later go on to describe as a ""historic blunder"". Finally, the baton was passed to Janata Dal's HD Deve Gowda but even after having the support of the Left Front and Congress, the Deve Gowda government couldn't last beyond a year. Post this, Inder Kumar Gujral came to the fore but even under his leadership, the government did not complete its full term due to constant internal squabble and a volatile relationship with Congress. Finally, the country went to polls again in 1998a and the BJP came to power.
The fragile nature of the Third Front became a powerful poll plank for the BJP. Its 1998 government lasted only 13 months, but in 1999, it returned to power and was able to form the first stable National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government that ran a full course. The BJP, which had earlier been snubbed because of its strong Hindutva agenda, gained the confidence of allies. This episode also led to the formation of more stable coalition governments in the future. Both the NDA and the two Congress-led UPA governments that followed, remained stable because regional parties did not want frequent elections.
The experiment also showed the importance of a larger, national party being the anchor of a coalition. It marked the consolidation and subsequently rather quick fragmentation of regional parties. The Janata Dal, which promised to be an alternative to the national parties, got reduced to a fallacious political figment and all its various constituents drifted apart.
Coming back to the current scenario, the latest entrant to the upcoming third front is NDA's estranged partner, N Chandrababu Naidu, whose Telegu Desam Party had moved a no-confidence motion against the Centre. But even Naidu has fewer friends in the political circle than he would like. The YSR Congress suspects that Naidu came to Delhi to look for a new alliance partner. ""That he is coming to Delhi to fight for the interests of the state is a humbug. Now that he has become isolated in state politics, he is trying for support from other parties,"" YSRC Rajya Sabha member V Vijaya Sai Reddy was quoted as telling Hindustan Times .
Jana Sena Party founder-president Pawan Kalyan also termed Naidu's visit as a ""political ploy"" of  TDP, accusing the chief minister of lacking a ""strong will and commitment"". The Left parties also believe that Naidu's party is to be equally blamed along with the BJP for the injustice done to Andhra Pradesh after its bifurcation and hence, they did not support Naidu's resolution at their meeting with him.
In the Hindi heartland, however, Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav is sounding confident after the by-poll victory and wishes to continue the alliance with BSP. He had admitted that this alliance will be only be limited to Uttar Pradesh, thus, rendering his party bereft of any possible national appeal. Akhilesh too has acknowledged Mamata's attempts to set up a 'federal front. But Congress doesn't seem convinced of her plans.
West Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury took a dig at Banerjee's proposal of putting up a ""one-to-one"" fight against the BJP and shot back saying that the Congress did not need any advice from her. Chowdhury claimed that Banerjee was trying to project herself as a 'pan-India leader'. ""She is advising the Congress on what to do and what not to. Who has appointed her as an adviser to the Congress? If you are serious about fighting the communal forces, you have to fight under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. Anti-BJP front will succeed only under Rahul's leadership,"" he said, according to PTI .
This mud-slinging has made the BJP leaders in Bengal happy. ""The people of India have seen enough of such political gimmicks and they are tired of it. Such attempts are a futile exercise to satisfy their ego and greed for power. The more they do such things the public support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi will increase,"" said Rahul Sinha, BJP's national secretary and former president of the state unit.
It is interesting to note here that the Left under the leadership of CPM leader Prakash Karat too had tried for a similar non-BJP, non-Congress front but had failed miserably.
The Congress on its part is taking things as they come. ""The battle for 2019 will be to preserve the founding vision of India. All people and forces who believe in this inclusive policy and idea of India have to come together and defeat the incumbent government. The objective is not about who will take the leadership position,"" Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told Hindustan Times .
Excluding the Congress completely may not be the most astute of strategies for the Third Front if they actually dare to conquer the BJP in the next Lok Sabha elections. The absence of a personality like Narendra Modi in the third front camp, at least for now, only makes the task even harder. After all these meetings in different parts of the country, the Third Front won't really love to see a third-rate performance going ahead in the next general elections. For now, here's hoping that all the power contenders keep their best 'front' forward.

Laying the foundation stone for the new super-speciality block and 11-KV substation and inaugurating the modern linear accelerator system for cancer treatment (LINAC) at the hospital on Thursday, Mr Vijayan said it's because of the concerted effort and commitment of its staff that such most modern equipment like LINAC could be installed.
""Specialty and super-speciality facilities are being set up at taluk and district hospitals across the state.

""Eight district hospitals have cath labs now. Cancer treatment facilities, like a mini Regional Cancer Centre, are being introduced in all medical colleges,"" she said. Mayor Soumini Jain while addressing the gathering assured that Kochi Corporation was ready to surrender its land for the development of the General Hospital if the state government gives alternative land.

""The tender for selection of consultant for preparation of the DPR was floated on April 3. The last date for submission of the bid is on April 27,"" said a senior metro official. Earlier, Vytilla Mobility Hub Society (VMHS) officials handed over the broad requirements to be considered during preparation of the DPR for the project which was already delayed for five years.
""One of the basic conditions was to have proper integration of metro rail with the road and water transportation modes. For instance a walkway can be built from the eight-metre high metro station coming in the hub to the bus and boat bays. We have also asked for maximum passenger amenities like passenger waiting area, toilet facilities, cloakroom, car and two-wheeler parking areas and signage among others,"" a senior VMHS official said.
The DPR will be prepared giving options for maximum open space and minimum commercial area required for sustainable functioning of the hub. Though KMRL initially asked for six months, the VMHS authorities wanted the process to be completed in half the period. ""Only upon preparation of the DPR, we can approach the French funding agency AFD for availing loan. We can't afford to delay the project anymore as we have already lost five years,"" the official said.
Earlier, the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organisation (KITCO) too was in the race for implementing agency. Phase-II involves construction of 120 bus bays and an underground parking bay for 1,000 two-wheelers and 800 cars among others. A total area of 25.16 acre was earmarked for the second phase.

In fact, the government’s aim was to protect the admissions of all the students which were cancelled by the Admission Supervisory Committee, documents accessed by DC show. The Chief Minister directed the health department to “prepare a note for the Cabinet meet on January 31 to decide whether the Competent Authority can be entrusted to lawfully take a decision after correcting the lapses pointed out by the law ministry.” And there is a story behind those ‘lapses’.
Competent Authority B. Srinivas, then principal secretary (health), went about preparing the list of students who lost admission for no fault of theirs with the help of the Commissioner of Entrance Examinations “as per laws and orders in force applicable for the academic year 2016-17” as mandated in the ordinance. He prepared a list of 44 among the 137 applicants from Kannur Medical College and 25 from 31 students from Karuna Medical College. He sent the report, along with a recommendation to take action against the management of Kannur Medical College. It was endorsed by the additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Sadanandan.
Law secretary B.G. Harindranath, whom legal experts say has no authority to sit in judgment over the report of a Competent Authority acting on behalf of the government, picked “lapses” in the report saying the Authority had not understood the ordinance properly and that he had no “material evidence” to take action against the erring management.
The Chief Minister, documents say, sided with the law secretary who identified the “lapses” which in fact were his recommendations to exclude 93 students of Kannur Medical College and six students of Karuna Medical College who would not have got admission even if the college had produced the documents on time and also to take action against the management. “If the government’s intention was to protect the meritorious students, then it should have gone ahead with regularising the admissions of those 69 students,” said a senior government official seeking anonymity. “Instead, the government trashed the CA’s report and regularised 118 students of Kannur and 31 students of Karuna. This betrays the government’s real intention.”",english

The Assembly had referred the Bill to the law department and it is likely to be sent to Governor P. Sathasivam for his assent. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government did not want to pick a fight with the court on the issue.
The government only wanted to support the students, he added. The same view was echoed by Health Minister K.K. Shyalaja. Former KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran has come down heavily on the Opposition for supporting the medical Bill passed by the Assembly. “The Opposition helped the unanimous passage of the Bill that regularises the anomalies committed by Kannur and Karuna medical colleges, which is a grave mistake,” Mr Sudheeran said. “Instead of exposing the move to protect self-financing colleges which want to mint money, the Opposition supported the Bill which is a serious flaw,” he said.
However, former chief minister Oommen Chandy, Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala and BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan said that they supported the Bill considering the future of the students. “We took the decision on humanitarian grounds,” said Mr Chandy.Mr Chennithala said that it was a joint decision taken by UDF leaders. “We will not turn a blind eye to the managements’ intention to loot money,” said Mr Chennithala.

Two years later a mass agitation over their decision to bring in a legislation to contain unhealthy practices and corruption in education sector led to their dismissal. Ironically, on the 61st anniversary of the swearing in of the EMS government, the LDF government led by Pinarayi Vijayan was put in the dock by the Supreme Court for supporting corrupt practices in the sector, including collection of capitation fee. 
The SC order nullifying the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularization of Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance 2017 is a slap on the face of the government, which a day ago hastened to pass a bill to replace the ordinance in the assembly, with support from opposition led by the Congress and even a lone BJP MP. 

The Bill passed by the assembly on Wednesday is on its way to Raj Bhavan. With Thursday’s SC order, it has become almost certain that the Governor, who is a former chief justice of India, will return the Bill to the assembly. The reaction of CM Pinarayi Vijayan to the court order hints that the government is even willing to repeal the bill as it doesn’t want to engage in a course of conflict with the Supreme Court. 

Sources in the government said that at least two senior bureaucrats had warned the government against the bill. But the CMO was adamant to bring the legislation and was aided by a recommendation from law secretary B G Hareendranath. The finding of ASC led by Justice James that Kannur MCH admitted students by accepting capitation fee ranging from Rs. 22 lakh to Rs. 45 lakh also didn’t deter the government. 

It is learnt that the highlevel connections and wealth of the managements of both colleges played key role in influencing the government decision. A religious leader based in Kozhikode, who is close to the Kannur college management, stitched together a united political front in defence of admissions. 

“It was surprising. All these years, CPM had fought for merit and were against capitation fee. The bill is against the spirit of this stand”, said political scientist J Prabhash . 

It is learnt that issue was discussed in the CPM state secretariat. However the secretariat was not apprised of the magnitude of the issue including the burden to defend even the capitation fee, by the leaders in the government, it is learnt. CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran said the draft bill was discussed in the LDF state committee. “After analyzing all situations, we took a lenient stand considering the future of the students”, Rajendran told TOI.",english

ബിജെപിയുടെ പിന്തുണ പരസ്യമായി കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ ലഭിച്ചിരുന്നു. എന്നാൽ അത്തരത്തിൽ പരസ്യമായി ഒരു രാഷ്ട്രീയപാര്‍ട്ടിക്കു കീഴിൽ അണിനിരക്കാൻ ഇനി വയല്‍ക്കിളികൾ തയ്യാറല്ല. എല്ലാ രാഷ്ട്രീയ പാർട്ടികളുടെയും പിന്തുണയാണ് സമരത്തിനു വേണ്ടത്, അല്ലാതെ ഹൈജാക്കിങ് അല്ല. ബിജെപി പിന്തുണ സ്വീകരിച്ചതുകൊണ്ട് ഒരിക്കലും സമരം ബിജെപിയുടേതാകില്ല. ആരൊക്കെ വന്നാലും പോയാലും ഞങ്ങൾ ഇപ്പോഴും കമ്യൂണിസ്റ്റുകളാണ്. എന്നാൽ സിപിഎം ലൈനിൽ തുടരുന്ന കാര്യത്തിൽ ആലോചന വേണം. ഇടതുപക്ഷത്തിൽ എത്രയോ കക്ഷികളുണ്ട്. വയൽക്കിളികളും ഇടതുപക്ഷമാണ്. ഇടതു പാർട്ടികൾ നയിക്കേണ്ട സമരമാണു ഇവിടെ നടത്തുന്നത്. സിപിഎമ്മിന്റെ കീഴിൽ നീതി ലഭിക്കില്ലെന്നു വ്യക്തമായതോടെയാണ് ‘വയൽക്കിളികൾ’ എന്ന പേരിൽ സമരം തുടങ്ങാന്‍ തീരുമാനമായത്. നാട്ടിലെ യുവാക്കളുടെയും ഭൂരിഭാഗം ജനങ്ങളുടെയും പിന്തുണ തുടക്കത്തിൽ വയൽ കിളികള്‍ക്കൊപ്പമായിരുന്നു. പാര്‍ട്ടി നിലപാട് മാറ്റിയതോടെ സമരക്കാര്‍ സിപിഎംവിരുദ്ധരായി– വയൽ കിളികൾ പറയുന്നു. 
സിപിഎം ‘ബോധവൽക്കരണ’വും ഭീഷണിയും 
രണ്ടു രീതിയിലാണ് സിപിഎം സമരത്തെ നേരിട്ടത്. കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ വീടുകൾ തോറും കയറിയിറങ്ങിയുള്ള ബോധവല്‍കരണം, പോസ്റ്റർ, നോട്ടിസ് പ്രചരണങ്ങൾ. കീഴാറ്റൂർ വയലിൽ ബൈപാസ് നിർമാണത്തിനായി അളവുകൾ രേഖപ്പെടുത്തിയതിന്റെ ഒരുവശം പൂർണമായും പാർട്ടിയുടെ കർഷക സംഘടനയായ ഓൾ ഇന്ത്യ കിസാൻ സഭ (എഐകെഎസ്)യുടെ കൊടികള്‍ സ്ഥാപിച്ച നിലയിലാണ്. നാടിന്റെ വികസനത്തിനായി സ്ഥലം വിട്ടുനൽകാൻ തയ്യാറാണെന്നു സ്ഥലമുടമകളുടെ പേരുൾപ്പെടെ പതിച്ച ബോർഡുകള്‍ ഓരോ കൊടിക്കും ചുവടെയായി സ്ഥാപിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. തളിപ്പറമ്പിൽ നിന്ന് കീഴാറ്റൂരിലേക്കുള്ള വഴികളിലും കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ മറ്റു പ്രദേശങ്ങളിലും വികസനത്തിനായി നാടൊന്നിക്കുകയെന്ന സന്ദേശവുമായുള്ള നോട്ടിസുകളും വ്യാപകമായി പതിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. 
സിപിഎമ്മിന്റെ ഭീഷണികൾ പലവിധത്തിലാണ് നാട്ടുകാരിലേക്ക് എത്തുന്നത്. വയൽ കിളികളെ പിന്തുണച്ചാൽ സർക്കാരിൽ നിന്നു ലഭിക്കുന്ന ആനുകൂല്യങ്ങളെല്ലാം തടസപ്പെടുത്തുമെന്ന് ഭീഷണിപ്പെടുത്തി. പെൻഷൻ വാങ്ങുന്നവർക്ക് അതു കിട്ടില്ല. സഹകരണ സ്ഥാപനങ്ങളിലെ ജോലികളിൽ നിന്ന് പിരിച്ചുവിടും എന്നിങ്ങനെയൊക്കെയായിരുന്നു ഭീഷണി. യുവാക്കള്‍ക്കു പാര്‍ട്ടി നിയന്ത്രണത്തിലുള്ള സ്ഥാപനങ്ങളിൽ ജോലി വാഗ്ദാനവും ചെയ്തു. ഇതോടെയാണ് വയൽ കിളികളുടെ സമരത്തിന് നാട്ടിൽ നിന്നുള്ള പിന്തുണ കുറയ്ക്കാൻ സിപിഎമ്മിനായത്. എന്നാൽ എല്ലാവരും പാര്‍ട്ടിയുടെ പ്രലോഭനങ്ങളിൽ വഴങ്ങില്ല. അവരെ കൂട്ടുപിടിച്ച് സമരവുമായി മുന്നോട്ടുപോകും– വയൽ കിളി പ്രവർത്തക കമലാക്ഷി പറഞ്ഞു. 
2016 സെപ്തംബറിൽ സിപിഎം വനിതാ നേതാവിന്റെ വീടിനു മുൻപിൽ റീത്തും ഭീഷണിക്കത്തും പ്രത്യക്ഷപ്പെട്ടതും നേരത്തെ വാർത്തയായിരുന്നു. പൂക്കോത്തുതെരുവിലെ സജീവ സിപിഎം പ്രവർത്തകരായ പി.ശങ്കരൻ നമ്പ്യാരുടെയും ഭാര്യ ടി.സി.ജാനകിയുടെയും വീടിനു മുൻപിലായിരുന്നു പൂക്കളും മറ്റും ഉപയോഗിച്ചു നിർമിച്ച റീത്തും ഭീഷണിക്കത്തും സ്ഥാപിച്ചത്. 
ബൈപാസ് പ്രശ്നത്തെച്ചൊല്ലി പ്രാദേശിക പ്രവർത്തകരാണ് റീത്ത് വച്ചതെന്ന് ആരോപണമുണ്ട്. കീഴാറ്റൂർ വഴി കടന്നുപോകുവാൻ നിർദേശിക്കപ്പെട്ട ദേശീയപാതയുടെ നിർദിഷ്ട ബൈപാസിനെ അനുകൂലിക്കുന്നതിനെതിരെയാണ് കത്ത്. ഒരു കത്ത് റീത്തിനൊപ്പവും മറ്റൊന്നു ഭിത്തിയിൽ പതിച്ച നിലയിലുമായിരുന്നു. തളിപ്പറമ്പിലെ അറിയപ്പെടുന്ന സിപിഎം പ്രവർത്തകരായ ഇവരുടെ വീടിനു മുൻപിൽ റീത്ത് വച്ചതറിഞ്ഞു പാർട്ടി നേതാക്കളും സ്ഥലത്തെത്തി. റീത്ത് വച്ചതിനു പിന്നിൽ സാമൂഹികവിരുദ്ധരാണെന്നും ഇതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് അന്വേഷിക്കുമെന്നും ഏരിയാ സെക്രട്ടറി പി.മുകുന്ദൻ പറഞ്ഞു. 
കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ നടക്കുന്നതെന്ത്? പരിഹാരം? കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ സമരമുഖത്ത് നിന്ന്. ഫയൽചിത്രം. 
ദേശീയപാത വികസിപ്പിക്കുന്നതിന്റെ ഭാഗമായാണ് തളിപ്പറമ്പ് നഗരത്തില്‍ നിന്ന് മാറി കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ ബൈപാസ് നിർമിക്കാൻ തീരുമാനമായത്. സ്ഥലമെടുപ്പ് എളുപ്പമല്ലെന്നു വിലയിരുത്തി വലയിലൂടെ ദേശീയപാതയ്ക്ക് ഇടം കണ്ടെത്തുകയായിരുന്നു. നഗരത്തിലെ മറ്റൊരു ഭാഗത്താണ് ആദ്യം ബൈപാസ് നിർമാണത്തിന് ഉദ്ദേശിച്ചത്. എന്നാൽ അവിടെ നൂറ്റിഇരുപതോളം വീടുകളും മറ്റു കെട്ടിടങ്ങളും കുറച്ചുഭാഗത്തു വയലുകളും ഇല്ലാതാകുമായിരുന്നു. 
പാടം നികത്തി റോഡ് പണിയുന്നതു ജൈവവ്യവസ്ഥയെ തകിടം മറിക്കുമെന്നും കടുത്ത വരൾച്ചയ്ക്ക് ഇടയാക്കുമെന്നും ആരോപിച്ചു സിപിഎം പ്രവർത്തകരുടെ തന്നെ മുൻകയ്യിലാണു വയൽക്കിളി കർഷക കൂട്ടായ്മ സമരം തുടങ്ങിയത്. ആദ്യഘട്ടത്തിൽ സമരം തുടങ്ങിയ സിപിഎം പ്രവർത്തകരിൽ ഒരുവിഭാഗം പിന്നീടു പിന്‍വലിഞ്ഞു. വയൽക്കിളികളോടൊപ്പം നിന്നവര്‍ക്കെതിരെ പാര്‍ട്ടി നടപടിയും സ്വീകരിച്ചു. സെന്റിനു നാലു ലക്ഷം രൂപ വരെ കിട്ടുമെന്നായതോടെ, ഭൂഉടമകളിൽ വലിയൊരു വിഭാഗം പിന്നീടു സമ്മതപത്രം നൽകി. 
കീഴാറ്റൂരിലെ നെൽവയൽ നികത്താതെ ആകാശപ്പാത നിർമിച്ച് തർക്കം പരിഹരിക്കാമെന്നതായിരുന്നു മറ്റൊരു മാർഗം. വയലിലൂടെ കടന്നുപോകുന്ന ഒരുകിലോമീറ്ററോളം ദൂരത്തിൽ എലിവേറ്റഡ് ഹൈവേ (ആകാശപ്പാത) നിർമിക്കുന്ന കാര്യത്തിൽ പാർട്ടിക്കും തർക്കങ്ങളില്ല. മേൽപാലം മതിയെന്നു കേന്ദ്ര സർക്കാർ തീരുമാനിച്ചാൽ സംസ്ഥാനം സഹകരിക്കുമെന്ന് സിപിഎം സംസ്ഥാന സെക്രട്ടറി കോടിയേരി ബാലകൃഷ്ണനും അറിയിച്ചു. എന്നാൽ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ കേന്ദ്രമന്ത്രി നിധിൻ ഗഡ്കരിയുമായി ഡൽഹിയിൽ കൂടിക്കാഴ്ച നടത്തിയപ്പോൾ കീഴാറ്റുർ വിഷയം ചർച്ച ചെയ്യാൻ തയ്യാറായിരുന്നില്ല. 
നിലവിലെ പാതയ്ക്കു മുകളിലൂടെ മേൽപാലം നിർമിക്കുകയെന്നതാണ് മറ്റൊരു വഴി. തളിപ്പറമ്പ് നഗരത്തിൽ മിക്കസ്ഥലത്തും ശരാശരി 30 മീറ്റർ വീതിയിൽ റോഡ് നിലവിലുണ്ട്. മിക്കയിടത്തും റോഡിനോടു ചേർന്നു സ്ഥലം ലഭ്യവുമാണ്. നഗരമധ്യത്തിലെ കെട്ടിടങ്ങൾ പൊളിച്ചുനീക്കുന്നത് ഒഴിവാക്കാൻ ഏഴാംമൈൽ മുതൽ ലൂർദ് ആശുപത്രി വരെ നിലവിലെ റോഡിനു മുകളിലൂടെ 2.1 കിലോമീറ്റർ മേൽപാലം നിർമിക്കാമെന്ന് ശാസ്ത്ര സാഹിത്യ പരിഷത് നടത്തിയ പഠന റിപ്പോർട്ടിൽ പറയുന്നു. 
സിപിഎം നിലപാട് കാട്ടി ജാഥ; ‘വിശദീകരണ’വുമായി വയൽക്കിളികളും കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ വരുന്ന റോഡിന്റെ അലൈൻമെന്റ് കാട്ടി തോട്ടിൽ അടയാളപ്പെടുത്തിയ കല്ല്. 
ഏപ്രിൽ മൂന്നിന് കീഴാറ്റൂരിൽ നിന്നു കണ്ണൂരിലേക്കു ബിജെപി നടത്തിയ മാർച്ചിന്റെ ഉദ്ഘാടന സമ്മേളനത്തിൽ വയൽക്കിളി സമരനേതാക്കളായ സുരേഷ് കീഴാറ്റൂരും നമ്പ്രാടത്ത് ജാനകിയും ബിജെപി നേതാക്കൾക്കൊപ്പം വേദി പങ്കിട്ടത് വിവാദമായിരുന്നു. വേദി പങ്കിട്ടതിനെതിരെ വ്യാപക വിമർശനമുയർ‌ന്ന സാഹചര്യത്തിൽ എതിർ പ്രചാരണങ്ങൾക്കു മറുപടിയുമായി വയൽക്കിളികൾ രംഗത്തുവരുന്നുവെന്നതാണ് പുതിയ വർത്തമാനം. കീഴാറ്റൂർ ബൈപാസ് വിഷയത്തിൽ പാർട്ടി നിലപാടു വിശദീകരിക്കാൻ സിപിഎം ആരംഭിച്ച ജാഥ സമാപിച്ച ശേഷം വയൽക്കിളി സമര ഐക്യദാർഢ്യ സമിതിയുടെ നേതൃത്വത്തിൽ കണ്ണൂരിൽ വിശദീകരണ പൊതുയോഗമോ ജില്ലാതലത്തിൽ വാഹനജാഥയോ സംഘടിപ്പിക്കാനാണ് ആലോചന. 
ആറന്മുളയിൽ വയൽനികത്തുന്നതിനെതിരായ സമരപ്പന്തലിൽ കുമ്മനം രാജശേഖരനും എം.എ.ബേബിയും ശോഭാ സുരേന്ദ്രനും ടി.എൻ.സീമയും ഒന്നിച്ചു വേദി പങ്കിട്ടതാണു വയൽക്കിളികൾ ബദൽപ്രചാരണത്തിൽ വയൽക്കിളികൾ ചൂണ്ടിക്കാട്ടുക. വയൽക്കിളി സമരപ്രശ്നം ഉൾപ്പെടെ ഉയർത്തി ‘സമാധാനം വികസനം’ എന്ന മുദ്രാവാക്യവുമായി സിപിഎം നടത്തുന്ന വടക്കൻമേഖലാ ജാഥ ഒൻപതിനാണ് തളിപ്പറമ്പിൽ സമാപിക്കുന്നത്. അതിനുശേഷമായിരിക്കും വയൽക്കിളികളുടെ മറുപടിയാത്രകൾ. × Advertisement related stories",malayalam

കോട്ടയം > അംഗബലം കൂട്ടിയും വിവരസാങ്കേതിക വിജ്ഞാനമടക്കം വ്യാപകമാക്കിയും പൊലീസ് സേനയെ കൂടുതൽ നവീകരിക്കുമെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ. കേരള പൊലീസ് ഓഫീസേഴ്സ് അസോസിയേഷന്റെ 30‐ാം സംസ്ഥാന സമ്മേളനത്തിന്റെ പ്രതിനിധി സമ്മേളനം ഉദ്ഘാടനം ചെയ്യുകയായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം.

Two years later a mass agitation over their decision to bring in a legislation to contain unhealthy practices and corruption in education sector led to their dismissal. Ironically, on the 61st anniversary of the swearing in of the EMS government, the LDF government led by Pinarayi Vijayan was put in the dock by the Supreme Court for supporting corrupt practices in the sector, including collection of capitation fee.
The SC order nullifying the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularization of Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance 2017 is a slap on the face of the government, which a day ago hastened to pass a bill to replace the ordinance in the assembly, with support from opposition led by the Congress and even a lone BJP MP.
The Bill passed by the assembly on Wednesday is on its way to Raj Bhavan. With Thursday’s SC order, it has become almost certain that the Governor, who is a former chief justice of India, will return the Bill to the assembly. The reaction of CM Pinarayi Vijayan to the court order hints that the government is even willing to repeal the bill as it doesn’t want to engage in a course of conflict with the Supreme Court.
Sources in the government said that at least two senior bureaucrats had warned the government against the bill. But the CMO was adamant to bring the legislation and was aided by a recommendation from law secretary B G Hareendranath. The finding of ASC led by Justice James that Kannur MCH admitted students by accepting capitation fee ranging from Rs. 22 lakh to Rs. 45 lakh also didn’t deter the government.
It is learnt that the highlevel connections and wealth of the managements of both colleges played key role in influencing the government decision. A religious leader based in Kozhikode, who is close to the Kannur college management, stitched together a united political front in defence of admissions.
“It was surprising. All these years, CPM had fought for merit and were against capitation fee. The bill is against the spirit of this stand”, said political scientist J Prabhash .
It is learnt that issue was discussed in the CPM state secretariat. However the secretariat was not apprised of the magnitude of the issue including the burden to defend even the capitation fee, by the leaders in the government, it is learnt. CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran said the draft bill was discussed in the LDF state committee. “After analyzing all situations, we took a lenient stand considering the future of the students”, Rajendran told TOI.",english

apex court had earlier declared illegal, in effect cancelling the admission of these third-year MBBS students – 150 from Kannur Medical College and 30 from Karuna Medical College in Palakkad .
On Wednesday, the state government and entire opposition – including the lone BJP MLA – had, in a rare show of unanimity, joined hands to pass a bill in the Kerala assembly that intended to turn the ordinance into law, a move they portrayed as a ‘humanitarian gesture’ to save the students almost half-way through their MBBS course. Dissenting voices within mainstream political parties however described it as a cynical ploy to placate the powerful management lobby of self-financing colleges.
The Medical Council of India (MCI) had approached the SC challenging the ordinance’s propriety and constitutional validity. Senior advocate Vikas Singh and lawyer Gaurav Sharma told a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit that the state government had violated the SC’s order.
Agreeing with the MCI’s plea, the bench said, “In our prima facie view, the ordinance in question blatantly seeks to nullify the binding effect of the order passed by this court…It was prima facie not open to sit over the judgment and validate those very admissions and to venture into regularising them.
“We, therefore, stay operation of the ordinance and make it clear that no student shall be permitted to reap any benefit of any action taken and they shall not be permitted to attend the college or classes or continue in medical colleges in any manner pursuant to the ordinance”.
Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, speaking to the media on the sidelines of a programme in Kochi, said the state government does not intend to challenge the Supreme Court verdict against the bill. He said the government would think of other follow-up actions.
CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan called the SC verdict “unfortunate” and said, “the apex court has not considered the good intention of the state government on the matter”. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said the entire opposition voted for the bill because of concern over the future of the students.
The Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance, 2017, was notified by the state government on October 20 last year to regularise the admission of students admitted in 2016 to Kannur and Karuna Medical Colleges. But the Admission and Supervisory Committee for Professional Colleges in Kerala had quashed the admissions saying it was not done in compliance with law and was illegal.
The committee’s decision was upheld by the Kerala high court and the SC in March last year. The courts dismissed the two self-financing medical colleges’ plea and barred them from re-admitting students to these seats for the 2016-17 academic year. The state government, thereafter, brought the ordinance – and subsequently the bill -- to regularise the admission.
The SC will take up the matter again after four weeks.",english

The Left government in Kerala has passed two industry-friendly legislations at one go this week. The newly passed Bills make any new entrepreneur, who applies for an industrial licence in Kerala, legally qualified as a licence-holder for five years, if the reply is delayed beyond 30 days of application. However, while trimming the red tape for industrial licence, the Assembly has been cautious about giving the enactment a green edge. Ample debate rang out over the clause that spells out that the industrial outfits will not need any licence to draw out groundwater for their usage. The amendment that was approved in the Bill affirms that the industrial outfit which draws out groundwater for its use will have to take licence for purifying and recycling the water thus used. “The two Bills, Kerala Investment Promotion and Facilitation Bill 2018 and Kerala Investment Promotion and Facilitation (No. 2) Bill, 2018, would push the state’s industrial promotion initiatives in coming months,” said state industry minister AC Moideen. However, on the argument of trade union leaders, the clause saying that the industrialist could draw from his choice of workers to load and unload goods was dropped. Instead, the new law warrants that for those tasks that need mechanical support or special skills, the entrepreneur can draw from his own pool or workers. The industrial licence will be valid for five years. Earlier, the validity was for one year. Besides simplifying the procedures for licences, one reason for introducing the Bill was to end the notorious practice of headload-workers in Kerala, demanding gawking charges (locally known as nokkukooli) from the employers. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier said that the nokkukooli practice will not be allowed from May 1.

Pinarayi is facing severe criticism within the party and outside when he is making efforts to develop Kerala as a dream state.
Malappuram police caned protesters today to disperse a mob protesting against NH land acquisition in AR Nagar in Malappuram and used three grenades to disperse the crowd.
National Highway road widening was in limbo in Kerala after both UDF and LDF governments took a passive role not to take over land for road widening. Kerala suffered for the last 20 years as traffic bottlenecks became part of Kerala's social life.

The resistance against land acquisition started when the Pinarayi government put GAIL pipeline laying in the state in their priority agenda. Later similar protests surfaced in Keezhattoor and other places where survey for new roads are progressing.
""Pinarayi has made sincere efforts and taken steps to widen roads in Kerala. But some groups with vested interests are working overtime to trigger controversies in every development projects in Kerala. Whether it's Keezhattoor or Malapuram, they have a hidden agenda when it comes on land acquisition,"" Sudhakar Manoharan, a software engineer based in Kochi told India Today.
Sudhakar, 29, may be a micro group in Kerala who wants fast model of development.
Majority of advocacy group are against the chief minister and the government's developmental projects.
According to Kamal Vardhana Rao, Principal Secretary Public Works Department in Kerala, the government had taken all precautions to sort out issues whenever it shoots up.

""I personally visited Keezhattur and government has offered highest value for land - Rs 4 lakh per cent for the land acquired for the road. Only four land owners are not willing to part with their land,"" Rao told India Today.
In Malappuram, the government decided to change alignment to save a temple and a mosque and tried to acquire 50 cents of land. But around 100 persons staged protests and police used teargas to disperse the protesting crowd today.
According to intelligence wing of Kerala police, the protesters are outside people camping in the area.
""We have intelligence inputs from the local areas revealing outside interference to trigger protests. Some groups are promoting social media campaign with false information telling police raided their homes and beaten children of protesters. It's factually incorrect,"" a senior Intelligence official in state police told India Today.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the government does not want any conflict with courts on the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill. 
“The government has not set out on a contest with the courts. That is the first thing that I wish to clarify. What has happened here is this: the future of several students was in jeopardy and everyone began exerting pressure on the government to take steps to protect the interests of the students,” the Chief Minister said in Kochi on Thursday, while explaining the rationale of the Bill passed by the Kerala Assembly on Wednesday. 
Saving the students: Shylaja 
Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said all that the government had done was to introduce a Bill to replace the ordinance promulgated to save the students from a major predicament. 
“I had told the students when they approached me that they would do well to look out for other options and that they would lose five years if the court were to decide against them after five years,” she pointed out. 
The legal issues involved in the Supreme Court verdict and the question whether the Bill would stand the scrutiny of law now that the Supreme Court has rejected the ordinance which it sought to replace would have to be studied in detail. Only legal experts would be able to say that, she added. 
Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan said he had signed the Bill adopted by the Assembly on Wednesday and forwarded it to the government to be forwarded to Governor P. Sathasivam. 
Meanwhile, CPI (M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the Supreme Court verdict nullifying the admission of 180 students was preconceived.",english

               കണ്ണൂർ, കരുണ മെഡിക്കൽ കോളേജ് പ്രവേശനം: സർക്കാർ നിലപാട് അപലപനീയം 
പ്രവേശനത്തിനുള്ള അംഗീകൃത മാനദണ്ഡങ്ങളൊന്നും പരിഗണിക്കാതെ വൻ തുകകൾ തലവരിപ്പണം വാങ്ങി വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ പ്രവേശിപ്പിച്ച കണ്ണൂർ, കരുണ സ്വാശ്രയ മെഡിക്കൽ കോളേജുകളിലെ പ്രവേശന നടപടികളെ സാധൂകരിക്കാൻ വേണ്ടി സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാർ കൊണ്ടുവന്ന ഓർഡിനൻസും കഴിഞ്ഞ ദിവസം നിയമസഭ ഏകകണ്ഠമായി പാസ്സാക്കിയ ബില്ലും കോഴക്കോളേജുകൾക്കും വിദ്യാഭ്യാസക്കച്ചവടത്തിനും എതിരെ കേരളീയ സമൂഹം പല ദശകങ്ങളായി നടത്തിപ്പോരുന്ന സമരങ്ങളോടുള്ള തികഞ്ഞ അവഹേളനമാണ്.

അഞ്ചരക്കണ്ടിയിലെ കണ്ണൂർ മെഡിക്കൽ കോളേജും പാലക്കാട്ടെ കരുണ മെഡിക്കൽ കോളേജും വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ പ്രവേശിപ്പിച്ചത് മെറിറ്റും ഇതര മാനദണ്ഡങ്ങളും നഗ്നമായി ലംഘിച്ചുകൊണ്ടാണെന്ന് സംസ്ഥാന സർക്കാർ നിയോഗിച്ച ജെയിംസ് കമ്മിറ്റി തന്നെ കണ്ടെത്തിയതാണ്. സ്വാശ്രയ കോളേജുകൾക്കും വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ കച്ചവടത്തിനും  അനുകൂലമായ വിധിന്യായങ്ങൾ പല വട്ടം പുറപ്പെടുവിച്ചിട്ടുള്ള കോടതികൾ പോലും ഈ കോളേജുകളിലെ പ്രവേശനം നിയമവിരുദ്ധമായി നടത്തിയതാണെന്നു കണ്ട് റദ്ദാക്കിയിരുന്നതാണ്. എന്നിട്ടും നിയമവിരുദ്ധമായ ആ പ്രവേശനങ്ങൾക്ക് സാധൂകരണം നൽകാൻ ഓർഡിനൻസു കൊണ്ടുവന്ന പിണറായി വിജയൻ സർക്കാർ കോഴക്കോളേജുകളെ  സംബന്ധിച്ച പ്രഖ്യാപിത ഇടതുപക്ഷ നിലപാടുകളെ  അപമാനിക്കുകയാണു ചെയ്തത്.

വിദ്യാഭ്യാസത്തെ കച്ചവടവത്ക്കരിക്കുന്ന സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ വ്യവസ്ഥയോട് സമരം ചെയ്തതിന്റെ പേരിൽ കടുത്ത പോലീസ് പീഡനങ്ങൾ ഏറ്റു വാങ്ങേണ്ടി വന്നിട്ടുള്ള നൂറു കണക്കിനു വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളും യുവജനങ്ങളുമുള്ള നാടാണു കേരളം. കണ്ണൂർ ജില്ലയിലെ കൂത്തുപറമ്പിൽ ഇടതു പക്ഷ യുവജന പ്രസ്ഥാനത്തിലെ അഞ്ചു യുവാക്കൾ രക്തസാക്ഷികളായത് സ്വാശ്രയ കോളേജുകൾക്കെതിരായ സമരത്തിലാണ്. ഈ യുവാക്കളുടെ രക്തസാക്ഷിത്വം ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ള ത്യാഗങ്ങളോട് ആദരവോ സഹഭാവമോ പുലർത്തുന്ന ആർക്കും കണ്ണൂർ, കരുണ കോളേജുകളിലെ നിയമവിരുദ്ധമായ പ്രവേശനത്തെ സാധൂകരിക്കാനുള്ള നിയമനിർമ്മാണത്തെ പിന്തുണക്കാനാവില്ല.

സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസത്തെ എതിർക്കുന്ന നിലപാട് പരസ്യമായി പ്രഖ്യാപിക്കുമ്പോൾ പോലും ഇത്തരം സ്ഥാപനങ്ങൾ നടത്തുന്ന വിദ്യാഭ്യാസകച്ചവടത്തോട് ശരിയായ ഒരു നിലപാടു സ്വീകരിക്കാനോ അധികാരത്തിലെത്തുമ്പോൾ ആ നിലപാടു പ്രയോഗത്തിൽ വരുത്താനോ കേരളം ഭരിക്കുന്ന ഇടതുപക്ഷ മുന്നണി ശ്രമിച്ചിട്ടില്ല. കൂത്തുപറമ്പു രക്തസാക്ഷിത്വത്തിനു ശേഷം പോലും സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസത്തോട് ഖണ്ഡിതമായ ഒരു സമീപനം സ്വീകരിക്കാൻ അവർ തയ്യാറായിട്ടില്ല. സ. വി. എസ്. അച്ച്യുതാനന്ദൻ മന്ത്രിസഭയിലെ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ മന്ത്രിയായിരുന്ന എം. എ. ബേബി സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ സ്ഥാപനങ്ങളെ നിയന്ത്രിക്കാനായി ഒരു നിയമം കൊണ്ടുവരികയും നിയമസഭ ഏകകണ്ഠമായി അതു പാസ്സാക്കുകയും ചെയ്തുവെങ്കിലും കോടതി ഇടപെടലിനെ തുടർന്ന് ആ നിയമം അസാധുവാക്കപ്പെടുകയായിരുന്നു. അതിനു ശേഷം ഇക്കാര്യത്തിൽ പിഴ തീർത്ത ഒരു നിയമനിർമ്മാണത്തിന് ഇടതുപക്ഷ മുന്നണി ഇതുവരെ തയ്യാറായിട്ടില്ല.

അതുകൊണ്ടു തന്നെ സ്വാശ്രയ, കോഴ കോളേജുകൾ കാര്യമായ പ്രതിഷേധമോ ചെറുത്തു നിൽപ്പുകളോ നേരിടാതെ പ്രവർത്തിച്ചു പോരുകയാണു കേരളത്തിൽ. ന്യൂനപക്ഷ അവകാശങ്ങളുടേയും സ്വകാര്യ സ്വത്തു സംരക്ഷണത്തിന്റേയും നിയമപരമായ സാങ്കേതികവശങ്ങൾ അവയ്ക്ക് അനുകൂലമായി തുടരുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നുണ്ട്.

സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസക്കച്ചവട വ്യവസ്ഥയുടെ ആവിഷ്ക്കർത്താക്കളും സംരക്ഷകരുമായ കോൺഗ്രസും യു.ഡി.എഫും കരുണ, കണ്ണൂർ കോളേജുകളുടെ ലാഭതാല്പര്യ സംരക്ഷണത്തിനു വേണ്ടി നില കൊള്ളുന്നതിൽ അസ്വാഭാവികമായി യാതൊന്നുമില്ല. ഇക്കാര്യത്തിൽ സർക്കാരിനെ വിമർശിച്ചു രംഗത്തെത്തിയ ബി.ജെ.പിക്കും വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ കച്ചവടത്തിന്റേയും കോഴക്കോളേജുകളുടേയും കാര്യത്തിൽ പിന്തിരിപ്പൻ നിലപാടുകൾ തന്നെയേ ഉള്ളു. കണ്ണൂർ, കരുണ കോളേജുകളുടെ കാര്യത്തിൽ നിയമനിർമ്മാണം നടത്തണമെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയോട് ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടവരിൽ ബി.ജെ.പിയുടെ സംസ്ഥാന അദ്ധ്യക്ഷൻ കൂടി ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നുവെന്ന് ഏവർക്കുമറിയാം.

എന്നാൽ, യു.ഡി.എഫോ ബി.ജെ.പി യോ പോലെ കോഴക്കോളേജുകളെ തുറന്നു തന്നെ പിന്തുണക്കുന്ന പാർട്ടികളുടേതിൽ നിന്നു വ്യത്യസ്തമായി വിദ്യാഭ്യാസക്കച്ചവടത്തിനെതിരായി നിരന്തര സമരം നടത്തുകയും രക്തസാക്ഷിത്വം ഉൾപ്പെടെയുള്ള വലിയ ത്യാഗങ്ങൾ ഏറ്റുവാങ്ങുകയും ചെയ്തിട്ടുള്ള ഇടതുപക്ഷ രാഷ്ട്രീയ പ്രസ്ഥാനങ്ങൾ കോഴക്കോളേജ് മുതലാളിമാരുടെ താൽപര്യ സംരക്ഷണാർത്ഥം ഓർഡിനൻസ് ഇറക്കാനും നിയമനിർമ്മാണം നടത്താനും കോടതികളിൽ കേസു വാദിക്കാനും തയ്യാറാവുന്നത് അങ്ങേയറ്റം അപലപനീയമാണ്. ഇടതു പക്ഷത്തിന്റേയും വലതുപക്ഷത്തിന്റേയും നിലപാടുകൾ ഒന്നു തന്നെയായിത്തീരുന്ന ആപത്ക്കരമായ ഒരു സാഹചര്യമാണിത്.

അഡ്മിഷൻ നേടിയ ഒരു ചെറു സംഘം വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളുടെ താല്പര്യമാണു തങ്ങൾ സംരക്ഷിക്കാൻ ശ്രമിക്കുന്നതെന്ന മുടന്തൻ ന്യായം കൊണ്ട് കേരളീയ സമൂഹത്തോടും വിദ്യാഭ്യാസക്കച്ചവടത്തിനെതിരെ സമരം ചെയ്ത ഇടതുപക്ഷ ജനവിഭാഗങ്ങളോടും കാണിച്ച അവഹേളനത്തെ സർക്കാരിനു മറച്ചുവക്കാനാവില്ല. വലതുപക്ഷ നിലപാടുകൾ പ്രാവർത്തികമാക്കാനും ലാഭതാല്പര്യങ്ങൾക്കു വേണ്ടി മാത്രം പ്രവർത്തിക്കുന്നവർക്കു വേണ്ടി അധികാരത്തെ ദുർവ്വിനിയോഗിക്കാനും ശ്രമിക്കുമ്പോൾ അവർ മറന്നു പോകുന്നത് തങ്ങൾ പ്രതിനിധീകരിക്കുന്നത് രാഷ്ട്രീയ ഇടതുപക്ഷത്തെയാണ് എന്ന പ്രാഥമിക വസ്തുതയെയാണ്. കേരളത്തിലെ ഇടതുപക്ഷ ജനാധിപത്യ മുന്നണിയും അതിനു നേതൃത്വം നൽകുന്നവരും ഈ യാഥാർത്ഥ്യം മനസ്സിലാക്കുകയും സ്വന്തം നിലപാടുകളിൽ ആവശ്യമായ തിരുത്തലുകൾ വരുത്തുകയും ചെയ്യുമെന്ന് ഞങ്ങൾ പ്രത്യാശിക്കുന്നു.

സ്വാശ്രയ കോളേജ്ര വിഷയത്തിൽ ഇടതുപക്ഷത്തിനും യു.ഡി.എഫിനും ബി.ജെ.പിക്കും ഒരേ നിലപാടു തന്നെയാണുള്ളതെന്നു വരുന്നത് കേരളീയ സമൂഹത്തെ സംബന്ധിച്ചേടത്തോളം ഒട്ടും അഭികാമ്യമായ കാര്യമല്ല. 180 വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളുടെ താല്പര്യത്തിന്റെ മറവിൽ മഹാഭൂരിപക്ഷം വരുന്ന വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളുടെ അവകാശങ്ങളെ നിഷേധിക്കുന്ന സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസവ്യവസ്ഥ സാധൂകരിക്കപ്പെട്ടു കൂടാ. സ്വാശ്രയ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ വ്യവസ്ഥയോടുള്ള ഇടതുപക്ഷത്തിന്റെ നിലപാട് സ്പഷ്ടമായും ഖണ്ഡിതമായും പ്രഖ്യാപിക്കാനുള്ള ഒരവസരമായി ഇടതു പക്ഷ മുന്നണി ഇന്നത്തെ സാഹചര്യത്തെ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തേണ്ടതുണ്ട്.

Supreme Court Stays Kerala Govt’s Ordinance Regularising 180 MBBS Admissions 
The Supreme Court has stayed Kerala Govt’s ordinance notified in October 2017 regularising the admissions of 180 students, which two official panels and the Medical Council of India had declared illegal. The state Assembly passed the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill, 2018, legitimising these admissions. On March 28, the Supreme Court had rejected a review petition which the state government had filed challenging its decision to uphold the Kerala High Court’s 2016 verdict cancelling the admissions. Both Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Kerala Health Minister KK Shylaja had said last week that the objective of the bill was to save the academic life of innocent students. The High Court had said that the admission procedure at Kannur Medical College and Karuna Medical College in Palakkad was not transparent, and that they had admitted these 180 students in place of more meritorious ones. Senior advocate Aryama Sundaram, who represented the colleges, told the bench that it could be assumed that the ordinance ceased to in effect after the Assembly passed the bill. The judges, however, observed that though the Act has been enacted, it cannot come into force until it is notified. The court refused to go into the bill, saying it would keep its focus on the ordinance as the governor may modify the bill.

The Supreme Court on Thursday rapped the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government for promulgating an ordinance to “blatantly nullify” last year’s apex court order freezing illegal medical admissions made in the State. 
Staying the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regularisation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Ordinance of 2017, a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit passed a scathing order, accusing the government of trying to bulldoze the court. 
“In our prima facie view, the ordinance in question blatantly seeks to nullify the binding effect of the order passed by this court. Prima facie it was not open to declare this court’s order as void or ineffective as was sought to be done by way of ordinance,” the Supreme Court observed in its order. 
“We, therefore, stay the operation of the ordinance and make it clear that no student shall be permitted to reap any benefit of any action taken and they shall not be permitted to attend the college or the classes or continue in medical colleges in any manner pursuant to the ordinance,” the Supreme Court ordered. 
It warned that any violation of the order “shall be treated seriously by this court.” 
On March 22 last year, the apex court cancelled the admission of 180 medical undergraduate students in the Kannur Medical College and the Karuna Medical College in Kerala owing to irregularities in admission procedure. 
Zero tolerance 
The apex court had ordered the termination of 150 admissions in the Kannur college and 30 in the Karuna college, thus sending a strong message to private professional colleges that there would be zero tolerance if irregularities were found in admissions even at the cost of derailing the academic future of the students involved.",english

സോഷ്യൽ മീഡിയായിലൂടെ മരുന്നിന്റെ ആവശ്യകത അറിയിച്ചു. തുടർന്ന് കേരളത്തിന്റെ വിവിധ ഭാഗങ്ങളിൽ നിന്നും ഗൾഫ് രാജ്യങ്ങളിൽ നിന്നുമൊക്കെ ആളുകൾ അവർക്കറിയാവുന്ന മെഡിക്കൽ സ്റ്റോറുകളിലും മെഡിക്കൽ റെപ്രസന്ററ്റീവുകളുമൊക്കെയായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടു. മെഡിക്കൽ സ്റ്റോറുകാരും വിവിധ തലത്തിൽ അന്വേഷിച്ചു. ഈ മരുന്ന് ലഭ്യമല്ല എന്നാണ് മറുപടി ലഭിച്ചത്. ഇതിനിടെ ചികിത്സയിലുള്ള രോഗിയുടെ മകൾ വിദേശത്തുനിന്നും കുറച്ചു ദിവസത്തേക്കുള്ള മരുന്ന് കൊടുത്തു വിട്ടതായി വിവരം ലഭിച്ചു. ചികിത്സ ആരംഭിക്കാൻ മരുന്ന് വരുന്നതും കാത്തിരിക്കുന്നതിനിടെ രോഗിയുടെ മകൻ യാദൃശ്ചികമായി കണ്ട ഒരു മാലാഖ(നേഴ്സ്) രണ്ടു ദിവസത്തെ മരുന്ന് സംഘടിപ്പിച്ചു നൽകി. അതോടെ ചികിത്സ ആരംഭിച്ചു. 14 ദിവസത്തെ ചികിത്സയാണ് ഇപ്പോൾ ഡോക്ടർ നിർദ്ദേശിച്ചിട്ടുള്ളത്.

""We believe that such a strong ecosystem could also become a good nurturing ground for startups from other parts of India and the world,"" Vijayan said in his inaugural address at 'Huddle Kerala', one of Asia s largest startup ecosystem congregations at nearby Kovalam. The two-day event is being organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) in association with Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IAMAI Startup Foundation. Kerala was the first state to come out with a startup policy, he said. In 2017, Kerala issued a policy document which specifically identified the interventions required to successfully develop new ventures in the state, he said. The state government observed youth entrepreneurship development as a key focus area, Vijayan said. The Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme outlined in the startup policy caters to developing technology, innovation and entrepreneurship among school and college students and aspiring professionals, he said. There were also programmes like training for startup CEOs and international exchange. All the schemes were available to the eligible startups through the incubation network facilitated by the KSUM. Currently, there are over 1,000 startups registered under the KSUM and the state has more than two lakh sq ft of incubation space available for startups, he said. For the last one year, the KSUM has funded 100 plus ideas which have potential to become successful ventures and create wealth and impact in the society. The government has provided innovation grants to these ideas to help them go to market and scale up faster. To make the investment available to the startups, a fund-of-fund programme has been created to invest in the startups operating from the state, the chief minister said. Within a short period of the launch of the scheme, several startups have benefited substantially from it, he said. Sharjah Digital Transformation Higher Committee Chairman Sheikh Fahim Bin Sultan Al Qasimi, who was the chief guest at the event, lauded the educational progress of Kerala in building up a strong startup ecosystem.

Sharat Damodaran and Praveen M P, both second year students of Nehru College, were arrested on Thursday and let off on bail, they said. Enquiry with regard to another student, Mohammed Aziz, was going on, sources said. Police had, two days ago, registered a case against three students on the basis of a written complaint by principal P V Pushpaja, seeking action against them for insulting her and causing 'mental agony' by their action. Members of the pro-CPI(M) Students Federation of India (SFI) had burst crackers, rejoicing at her retirement and humiliated her by paying 'homage' last week by putting up a poster offering 'condolences' to a teacher ""who had died in the hearts of students."" Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had also condemned the incident in the state Assembly and assured that strong action would be taken against the students. The incident came to the limelight after a purported video of the students bursting crackers and putting up the condolence message at the auditorium of the college campus went viral on social media. The incident had also triggered widespread condemnation from different quarters. Last year, SFI students had set on fire the chair of Maharaja's College principal, N L Beena, in Kochi, during a strike by the teachers' union. In 2016, some students of Government Victoria College, Palakkad, had built a symbolic grave for their outgoing principal, Dr T N Sarasu.",english

The CM further said there were people who present themselves as respectable people but at same time indulge in criminal activities. “Such people are more seen in towns and cities. Some of them would be well-known faces. Police should not take any soft approach towards them. There is no need to wait thinking,” he said.
He also urged the officers to keep details of each household under their jurisdictions to keep a tab on criminals. Though he lauded the state police for its service, he said that a few isolated incidents have brought disrepute to the department.
In an apparent dig at former DGP TP Senkumar, Vijayan said he was surprised by the statements of a former top cop that Janamaithry project was not really part of the duties of the police. Senkumar had said that the workload of the police was very high due to activities like Janamaithry.
Vijayan said that he does not understand whether the police should act only after some untoward incident takes place. He also said that nobody should look up to him as a role model.
State police chief Loknath Behera announced that the officers from the rank of the ASI to CI would be allowed to wear cloth caps, according to circumstances. Till now, only top police officers from senior DSPs, IPS officers and SPs were allowed to wear such caps.
He also said that special cybercrime teams would be posted in all police stations. “Three cops will be there in each team. These personnel won’t be transferred for a minimum period of three years,” said Behera.",english

Speaking to media on the sidelines of a programme in Kochi on Thursday, the chief minister said the government would think of follow-up actions.
There was pressure from different quarters including the public for the government to interfere in the matter, Pinarayi Vijayan said. The bill was introduced after considering the fate of the students who got admissions in these two medical colleges. Those including the opposition pledged their support for the government to bring in legislation to regularize the admissions.
Health minister K K Shylaja said the government introduced the bill for protecting the interests of the students. Stating that both these colleges made admissions by cheating the government, she said the government has no soft corners for them.
Shylaja said the government took advise from legal experts including attorney general before presenting the bill. But the government had apprehensions whether the bill would stand if it is challenged in the court, she admitted. “After considering the opinion of legal experts and the opposition we decided to bring in the legislation,” the minister said.
Shylaja said the they will act as per the court order. “Earlier, we had advised the students and parents to explore other options, but they didn’t heed it citing huge banks loans they have already taken for getting admissions,” she said.",english

One of Kerala’s rare startup success stories has been Genrobotics – the company that brought the popular robot to replace man in cleaning the state’s filthy manholes. On day one of the ‘Huddle Kerala’ startup conclave on the coast of picturesque Kovalam on Friday, Arun George, the co-founder of the company, spoke at length to IndianExpress.com about the praise and compliments that have washed over him and his friends in recent months and the challenges they looked forward to. 
“Even when we were working with corporate companies, we were never happy. We felt that our talents were not being recognised. We always wanted to build a startup,” says George, an electrical and electronics engineering graduate from MES College in Kuttipuram.

It was in 2015, when George and his friends were working with different firms, that they came across a news report announcing the death of two manual scavenging workers in Kozhikode while they were cleaning a manhole. The germ of an idea to use technology to fight social evils, embedded deep in their hearts right from college, propelled them to quit their cushy jobs and dive headlong into the troubled waters of startup-culture. An extensive period of research and development followed that got them talking to manual scavenging workers to closely understand their work, their life and their struggles. 
“We are engineers so we knew we could solve this. We worked day and night at Technopark,” said George, referring to the IT park in Thiruvananthapuram, home to several corporate firms and incubators. It cost George and his team nearly Rs 10 lakhs to build the first Bandicoot, but he says with manufacturing in bulk, the costs could come down substantially. (Express photo) 
They came up with the idea of Bandicoot, a semi-automatic robot that could lower itself down to 10 metres deep, clean the manhole by picking up slush and collecting it in a bucket attached to it. The prototype they came up with in nine months, funded by the Kerala Innovation Grant, was designed in such a way that it could lift the manhole cover using magnetic technology and perform functions like positioning the sewer jetting pipe. An advanced nano coating technology would keep the machine dirt-free and easy to clean. 
George claims Bandicoot can clean a manhole in 20 minutes, much less than what man takes, and designed in such a way that it can be operated by the workers themselves, thereby protecting their employment. While the robot has to be positioned manually by the workers, the cleaning will be done on its own. 
Earlier this year, the efforts of Genrobotics paid off as the Kerala government greenlighted the project and bought the first of the Bandicoots to help workers in Thiruvananthapuram. States like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have also expressed strong interest, both states with large number of undocumented manual scavengers. George and his colleagues were also invited for a national consultative workshop on solid and liquid waste water management in New Delhi where then Ganga Rejuvenation Minister Uma Bharti was reportedly impressed. Later this month, the team will travel to Bihar for an event that will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . 
It cost George and his team nearly Rs 10 lakhs to build the first Bandicoot, but he says with manufacturing in bulk, the costs could come down substantially. The team have also received national and international patents. Elevating the project to the national level and perhaps even linking it with the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan are goals in front of George and his friends. 
“We are currently training the workers on using the product. They are expressing good feedback. Earlier, they were sewage workers, but now they are called operators. So we are happy to see their status elevated,” said George.   © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Share your thoughts",english

തിരുവനന്തപുരം > രാജ്യത്തെ സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് ഹബ്ബായി കേരളം മാറുകയാണെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ പറഞ്ഞു. ഈ രംഗത്ത് വരുംനാളുകളിൽ വലിയ കുതിപ്പാണ് സംസ്ഥാനം കൈവരിക്കാൻ പോകുന്നത്. സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകൾക്ക് എല്ലാ പിന്തുണയും സഹായവും സർക്കാർ നൽകുമെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി വ്യക്തമാക്കി. 
സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകളും നിക്ഷേപകരും സാങ്കേതികവിദഗ്ധരും ഒന്നിക്കുന്ന 'ഹഡിൽകേരള' ദ്വിദിന സമ്മേളനം കോവളത്ത് ഉദ്ഘാടനം ചെയ്യുകയായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം. സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകൾക്ക് മികച്ച അന്തരീക്ഷമൊരുക്കുന്നതിൽ കേരളം മുൻനിരയിലാണ്. വിനോദസഞ്ചാരികളുടെ മുൻനിര ആകർഷണകേന്ദ്രമെന്ന ഖ്യാതി കേരളത്തിനുണ്ട്. ഇപ്പോൾ സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകളെ ആകർഷിക്കാനാകുന്ന മികച്ച ലക്ഷ്യകേന്ദ്രമെന്ന പേരും നേടി. 
മറ്റ് സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളിൽനിന്ന് വിഭിന്നമായി നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടിലെ പ്രതിഭകളെയും കണ്ടുപിടിത്തങ്ങളെയും കണ്ടെത്തി പ്രോത്സാഹിപ്പിക്കാനുള്ള പ്രത്യേക മാതൃകയും സൃഷ്ടിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇത്തരം ശക്തമായ അന്തരീക്ഷം മറ്റ് സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളിൽനിന്നും രാജ്യങ്ങളിൽനിന്നുമുള്ള സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകൾക്കും മികച്ച അവസരങ്ങൾ ഒരുക്കും. 
കേരളത്തിൽ തുടങ്ങുന്ന സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകൾക്ക് സർക്കാർതന്നെ നേരിട്ട് നിക്ഷേപം നടത്താനുള്ള തീരുമാനം നിർണായകമായിരുന്നു. ആദ്യമായി ഒരു സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് നയമുണ്ടാക്കിയ സംസ്ഥാനമാണ് കേരളം. പുതുസംരംഭങ്ങളുടെ വിജയത്തിന് എന്തെല്ലാം ഇടപെടലുകൾ ആവശ്യമാണെന്ന് കണ്ടെത്തി സൂചിപ്പിക്കുന്ന രണ്ടാമത് നയരേഖയും 2017ൽ പുറത്തിറക്കി. 
സ്കൂൾ, കോളേജ് വിദ്യാർഥികളുടെയും പ്രൊഫഷണലുകളുടെയും സംരംഭകത്വവും നൂതനാശയങ്ങളും പ്രോത്സാഹിപ്പിക്കാനും സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് നയത്തിൽ പദ്ധതികളുണ്ട്. സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് മിഷനുകീഴിൽ നിലവിൽ ആയിരത്തിലധികം സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകൾ രജിസ്റ്റർ ചെയ്തിട്ടുള്ളത് പ്രത്യാശയുളവാക്കുന്നതാണ്. രണ്ടുലക്ഷം ചതുരശ്ര അടി ഇൻകുബേഷൻ സ്പേസ് സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകൾക്കായി ഒരുക്കിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. സമൂഹത്തിന് മുതൽക്കൂട്ടാകുന്ന നൂറിലധികം ആശയങ്ങൾ സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് മിഷൻ കണ്ടെത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. സർക്കാർ ഇവർക്ക് ഇന്നവേഷൻ ഗ്രാന്റ് നൽകി ആശയങ്ങൾ പ്രാവർത്തികമാക്കുന്നതിൽ സഹായിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. സംസ്ഥാനത്ത് പ്രവർത്തിക്കുന്ന സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പുകളിൽ നിക്ഷേപത്തിനായി ഫണ്ട് ഓഫ് ഫണ്ട് പദ്ധതിയും സർക്കാർ തുടങ്ങിയതായി മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു. 
കേരളവുമായി ഷാർജ സഹകരിക്കും തിരുവനന്തപുരം > സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് സംരംഭങ്ങളിലടക്കം കേരളത്തിന്റെ പ്രവർത്തനങ്ങൾ മാതൃകാപരമാണെന്ന് ഷാർജ സർക്കാരിന്റെ എക്സിക്യൂട്ടീവ് ചെയർമാൻ ഷേഖ് ഫഹീം ബിൻ സുൽത്താൻ അൽ ഖസിമി പറഞ്ഞു. ഇതിന് നേതൃത്വം നൽകുന്ന മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയനെ അദ്ദേഹം അഭിനന്ദിച്ചു. സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് രംഗത്ത് കേരളവുമായി കൂടുതൽ സഹകരിക്കാൻ തയ്യാറാണെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം വ്യക്തമാക്കി. 'ഹഡിൽകേരള' സമ്മേളനത്തിൽ മുഖ്യപ്രഭാഷണം നടത്തുകയായിരുന്നു സുൽത്താൻ. 
കേരളം രണ്ടാംവീടാണെന്നു പറഞ്ഞുകൊണ്ടാണ് അദ്ദേഹം തന്റെ പ്രസംഗം തുടങ്ങിയത്. ഡേറ്റയാണ് ഇനി ഏതൊരു രാജ്യത്തിന്റെയും ഭാവി. യുഎഇയും ഇന്ത്യയും തമ്മിലുള്ള സഹകരണം ശക്തമാണ്. ഇത് ഐടി മേഖലയിലേക്കും വ്യാപിപ്പിക്കണം. പൗരന് ഉപകാരപ്രദമാകുന്നതാകണം സാങ്കേതികവിദ്യയുടെ വികസനം. വിദ്യാഭ്യാസപുരോഗതി, മികച്ച സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് അന്തരീക്ഷം, അന്താരാഷ്ട്രബന്ധങ്ങൾ എന്നിവയാണ് ഐടി പുരോഗതിയിൽ നിർണായകഘടകം. ഷാർജയിൽ ഒരു കേരള സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്, കേരളത്തിൽ ഒരു ഷാർജ സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ് എന്നതാണ് സ്വപ്നമെന്നും സുൽത്താൻ പറഞ്ഞു.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three-day visit to the UK for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meet in London between April 18 and 20 will be high on optics-a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and a possible bilateral meet with British PM Theresa May. But the most closely watched event will be an open house before a select audience of diasporic desis. The 'Bharat ki Baat, Sabke Saath' will see a few hundred carefully screened invitees jostling to quiz Modi, live on global television. Sources say the PMO wanted an event to stand apart at the jam-packed CHOGM that 53 heads of government will attend.

Union minister Nitin Gadkari is willing to cross party lines when it comes to roads and development. He recently lavished praise on Pinarayi Vijayan on the land acquisition for national highways after meeting the Kerala chief minister in Delhi. The catch? His party's state unit has been attacking Vijayan over land acquisition and has supported one such agitation in Kannur. A case of the left hand not knowing what the right is doing? 
Son also rises 
A front page ad in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana congratulating the Yuva Sena for winning all 10 seats of Mumbai University Senate has led to a fair amount of interest in political circles. The ad had a picture of Uddhav Thackeray's youngest son Tejas. The grapevine has it that Tejas will be appointed Yuva Sena president and his elder brother Aditya, currently youth wing chief, has been elevated to the main party.

Congress leader Digvijaya Singh completed his 'Narmada Parikrama' on April 9. Singh, who maintains his padayatra is an apolitical exercise, has not made a single political statement during its course. However, BJP leaders are preparing a counter to the list of 'issues'- like pollution, illegal sand mining and failed plantation-he may raise after the yatra. Will the Raja of Raghogarh surprise them?

Antony has disapproved of the Kerala Professional Colleges (Regulation of Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill unanimously passed by the state Assembly. “It is painful that the Opposition joined hands with the ruling party to pass the Bill which will help only the managements,” he told reporters here on Friday. “Many progressive bills had been passed by the Assembly earlier. The government should have found other ways to help the eligible students,” said Mr Antony.
“I am not over-enthusiastic about the verdict of the Supreme Court. This is only a stay order. The ruling front and the Opposition should unite to end the threats and wrong practices of the managements,” he said. Earlier, a section of the Congressmen had said that the party had lost a golden opportunity to pull down the government. Even the BJP was divided on the Bill with state president Kummanam Rajasekharan supporting it and Mr V. Muraleedharan MP opposing it.
Mr Rajasekharan justified a letter he had sent to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on behalf of the students of the medical colleges. “I was approached by the students of Kannur Medical College complaining that they could not sit for the first-year MBBS examinations even after taking the model examinations. I only forwarded their complaint to the chief minister’s office,” he said. “Just because I sent a representation to the chief minister’s office, it doesn’t mean that I supported the corruption that happened in connection with the admissions,” he said.",english

Strongly condemning the police action against local people at A.R. Nagar in Malappuram, the opposition leader said instead of taking people into confidence, the government was using police force to acquire land forcibly. “Is Kerala under military rule?” he asked
Chennithala said the people who are protesting in the area have serious apprehensions about losing their land and places of dwelling because of the decision to alter the alignment for national highway. “They are being treated like enemies of the country. Women and children were being brutally assaulted. Several children were injured in today’s police action. The cops barged into the houses of people, ransacked the household goods and even attacked the inmates. Fear has gripped the entire area because of the terror unleashed by the police,” he said.
The opposition leader said the Pinarayi government had shown the same ruthlessness that was witnessed in Keezhattoor and Kuttupuram when land acquisition was carried out for national highway development. “The government is resorting to repressive measures to deal with the poor residents. It wants to forcibly take away their land in the name road development. We cannot allow this to happen,” he added. Chennithala said the government should stop the survey activities in Vengara with immediate effect and hold discussions with the local people to resolve the issue amicably.",english

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Courting controversies and scoring self-goals seem to have become a habit with the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. 

The latest issue in which the LDF government has shot itself in the foot relates to the ordinance by the Kerala Government which sought to regularize admission of 180 students in two medical colleges. The Supreme Court stayed the ordinance, effectively cancelling the admission of these third-year MBBS students – 150 from Kannur Medical College and 30 from Karuna Medical College in Palakkad. 

The ordinance sought to ‘blatantly nullify’ the apex court’s order of last year freezing illegal medical admissions in the state. The SC order staying the ordinance also made it clear that no student “shall be permitted to reap any benefit of any action taken and they shall not be permitted to attend college or classes or continue in the medical colleges pursuant to the order.” It also waned that violation of the order “shall be treated seriously by the court.” 

On March 22 last year, the SC had cancelled the admission of 180 students in the Kannur Medical College and Karuna Medical College owing to irregularities in the admission procedure. 

The order sends a strong message to the managements of self-financing colleges that there would be no tolerance of admission irregularities even if it meant endangering the future of the students involved. 

In a rare show of unity, the government and the opposition then joined hands to pass a bill in the state Assembly which sought to turn the ordinance into law – ostensibly to save the students half way through their MBBS course. However, the real aim of the move is to placate the powerful management lobby of self-financing colleges, it is alleged. 

There is an air of uncertainty over the bill, which has been sent to the Governor for his assent. But legal experts say the Governor, a former SC chief justice, is unlikely to give his assent in view of the SC’s stay of the ordinance. 

Major fallout of the unanimous passage of the bill has been a division in both the Congress and the BJP. Former KPCC chief V M Sudheeran set the ball rolling by openly criticizing the Congress-led UDF’s support to get the Bill passed. Leader of the opposition, Ramesh Chennithala, however, defended the action saying that the opposition backed the bill on humanitarian grounds to protect the future of the affected students. The intention was not to validate the violation of law by the managements of the two medical colleges in focus, he added. 

Likewise, the issue saw the BJP leaders coming out with contradictory statements. Rajya Sabha member V. Muraleedharan opposed the support extended to the bill by BJP state chief Kummanam Rajashekharan and the party’s lone MLA O Rajagopal. The BJP cannot condone corruption in the name of protecting the future of students, he opined. 

The ball is now in the court of the Governor. He can return the bill seeking further clarifications. If the government decides to go ahead with the bill, ignoring the opposition to it and furore it has created, then it can return the bill to the Governor with clarifications. If the Governor still refuses to sign it, the government may stop pursuing the matter at that stage. If the Governor grants his assent, the Medical Council of India may move the court questioning its validity. 

Whatever the decision of the Governor, the government has lost its face. It has exposed itself to the criticism that by getting the bill passed by the assembly, in the name of protecting the future of the students, it has, in effect, sought to validate the violation of law indulged in by the managements. The government, the opposition contends, could have explored other avenues to save the students instead of pushing ahead with the bill despite the SC’s criticism. The government also lost an opportunity to penalize the erring medical colleges by cancelling their registration, they argue. In conclusion, it can be said with certainty that the government will have to pay a heavy price in legal, moral and political terms in the long run. (IPA Service)",english

Thiruvananthapuram: Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala has urged the Election Commission to not delay the announcement of the date for the bypoll to Chengannur Assembly constituency in the state. 
Chennithala had sent a letter in this regard to the Chief Election Commissioner Om Prakash Rawat on Friday. 
""However, the date for the Chengannur bypoll had not been announced so far even after the date for the Karnataka Assembly election was declared,"" the Leader of Opposition had stated in the letter. 
""The reason for the delay is not yet clear,"" he said. File image of Ramesh Chennithala. News18 
The bypoll was necessitated following CPM MLA KK Ramachandran Nair's death in January, he added. 
A triangular contest is expected as major fronts, including the ruling LDF, Opposition UDF and BJP, have announced the candidates and begun campaigning, Chennithala said. 
Saji Cheriyan, a senior CPM leader, was the candidate of the LDF while the UDF has announced D Vijayakumar as its candidate. 
The BJP is fielding former state party president PS Sreedharan Pillai. 
The bypoll result would be seen as a referendum to the nearly two-year-old LDF government headed by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. 
The Opposition Congress had already made it clear that the by-election result would be a reflection of not only the rule of the state government but also that of the BJP-led NDA at the Centre. 
Chengannur was one of the traditional strongholds of the UDF but lost it to the LDF in the Assembly elections in 2016.

തിരുവനന്തപുരം∙ കണ്ണൂര്‍, കരുണ മെഡിക്കല്‍ കോളജുകളില്‍ 2016 - 17ല്‍ ക്രമവിരുദ്ധമായി പ്രവേശനം നേടിയ 180 വിദ്യാര്‍ഥികളെ സംരക്ഷിക്കാന്‍ സംസ്ഥാന സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ നിയമസഭയില്‍ പാസാക്കിയ ബില്‍ ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ ഒപ്പിട്ടില്ല. ‘കേരള മെഡിക്കല്‍ കോളജ് പ്രവേശനം സാധൂകരിക്കല്‍ ബില്‍’ ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ തള്ളിയതോടെ ഇതുവരെയുള്ള സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ നടപടികളെല്ലാം അസാധുവായി. ബില്ലിനു മുന്നോടിയാല്‍ സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ പുറപ്പെടുവിച്ച ഓര്‍ഡിനന്‍സ് നേരത്തെ സുപ്രീംകോടതി തള്ളിയിരുന്നു. ഇനി ഓര്‍ഡിനന്‍സ് പുറത്തിറക്കണമെങ്കില്‍ പുതിയ വ്യവസ്ഥകള്‍ ഉള്‍പ്പെടുത്തി നടപടിക്രമങ്ങള്‍ ആദ്യം മുതല്‍ തുടങ്ങണം. 
മതിയായ കാരണങ്ങളുണ്ടെങ്കില്‍ ബില്‍ തിരിച്ചയ്ക്കാനുള്ള അധികാരം ഭരണഘടനയുടെ 200-ാം അനുച്ഛേദം അനുസരിച്ച് ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ക്കുണ്ട്. അതിനുശേഷവും നിയമസഭ ആദ്യ നിലപാടില്‍ ഉറച്ചുനിന്നാല്‍ ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ക്ക് ബില്ലില്‍ ഒപ്പിടേണ്ടതായി വരും. നിലവിലെ സാഹചര്യത്തില്‍ ബില്‍ വീണ്ടും ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ക്ക് അയയ്ക്കാനുള്ള സാധ്യതയില്ല. ബില്‍ വീണ്ടും പരിഗണനയ്ക്കും വരികയും ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ ഒപ്പിടാന്‍ നിര്‍ബന്ധിതനാകുകയും ചെയ്താല്‍ നിയമമാകും. പക്ഷേ, വരും ദിനങ്ങളില്‍ അതു സുപ്രീംകോടതിയില്‍ ചോദ്യം ചെയ്യപ്പെടാം. 
ഭരണഘടനയുടെ 200-ാം അനുച്ഛേദത്തില്‍ പറയുന്നതനുസരിച്ച്, സര്‍ക്കാരിന്റെ നിയമ നിര്‍ദേശങ്ങള്‍ ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ക്ക് അംഗീകരിക്കുകയോ, അംഗീകരിക്കാതിരിക്കുകയോ, പുനഃപരിശോധിക്കാന്‍ തിരിച്ച് അയയ്ക്കുകയോ, രാഷ്ട്രപതിക്ക് അയയ്ക്കുകയോ ചെയ്യാം. ഇവിടെ സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ പാസാക്കിയ ബില്ലിന് അനുമതി നല്‍കാന്‍ ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ തയ്യാറായില്ല. സര്‍ക്കാരിനു തിരിച്ചയച്ച ഫയലില്‍ ഇതിന്റെ കാരണങ്ങള്‍ നാല് പാരഗ്രാഫില്‍ ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ വ്യക്തമാക്കിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. 
സുപ്രീംകോടതി വിധിയില്‍ പറഞ്ഞ കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ വിശദീകരണക്കുറിപ്പില്‍ പറഞ്ഞിട്ടുള്ളത്. ‘പ്രവേശനത്തിന് നിര്‍ബന്ധമായും പാലിക്കേണ്ട സുപ്രീം കോടതിയുടെ നിര്‍ദേശങ്ങളാണ് ഓര്‍ഡിനന്‍സിലൂടെ ഇല്ലാതായത്. ഉത്തരവ് മറികടന്ന് പ്രവേശനം ക്രമപ്പെടുത്തുന്നത് അനുവദിക്കാകാനാകില്ല എന്നതടക്കമുള്ള കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ സുപ്രീംകോടതി വ്യക്തമാക്കിയിട്ടുള്ളതിനാല്‍ നിയമസഭ പാസാക്കിയ ബില്ലിന് അനുമതി നല്‍കുന്നില്ല’ - ഗവര്‍ണര്‍ ഫയലില്‍ എഴുതി.

The UDF has decided to take up the cause of Dalit autorickshaw driver Eramangalath Chithralekha, whose allotted five cents of land has been cancelled by the LDF government. 
The previous government had allotted her the land following her agitation highlighting alleged threat to her life and property from local CPI(M) workers in her native village of Edat near Payyannur. 
UDF leaders led by senior Congress leader K. Sudhakaran and local MLA and IUML leader K.M. Shaji on Saturday visited the five-cent plot at Kattampally here where a small house is under construction for Ms. Chithralekha with funds mobilised by the MLA and an Abu Dhabi-based Malayali organisation ‘Green Voice.’ 
The government order cancelling the allotment of the land at Kattampally was seen as a move to harass her. 
Speaking to reporters during his visit to the plot, Mr. Sudhakaran said that she had been allotted the land by the Oommen Chandy government on her plea that she was not being allowed to live in her native village by the local CPI(M) and Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) workers. The local CPI(M) workers had actually exiled her from her village, he said adding that the previous government sanctioned the land at Kattampally after examining all the issues using the special powers vested with the government to take such decisions. The reason cited for cancelling the allotment of the land was that Chithralekha owns a six-cent land at Edat, he said adding that the land owned by her grandmother was transferred to her name for allowing her to take loan for buying an autorickshaw. 
“Ms. Chithralekha did not conceal this fact as her application for the land to the government mentioned that the six-cent land at Edat was in her name,” the Congress leader said. It was a gift deed executed by her grandmother without delivery of possession, he noted. CM must intervene 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should intervene to ensure that the Dalit woman was allowed to live in peace by earning a living from her work, he said. No government could take back the land allotted to Ms. Chithralekha, he said. 
Mr. Shaji said that Ms. Chithralekha was a symbol. It was unbelievable that the State Cabinet had decided to take back the five-cent land of a Dalit woman. “We will complete the construction of the house,” he said. 
District Congress president Satheeshan Pacheni and Ms. Chithralekha were also present.",english

The UDF has decided to take up the cause of Dalit autorickshaw driver Eramangalath Chithralekha whose allotted five cents of land has been cancelled by the LDF government. 
The previous government had allotted her the land following her agitation highlighting an alleged threat to her life and property from local CPI(M) workers in her native village of Edat, near Payyannur. 
UDF leaders, led by Congress leader K. Sudhakaran and local MLA and Indian Union Muslim League leader K.M. Shaji, on Saturday visited the five-cent plot at Kattampally where a small house is under construction for Ms. Chithralekha with funds mobilised by the MLA and the Abu Dhabi-based Malayali organisation Green Voice. 
The government order cancelling the allotment of the land at Kattampally was seen as a move to harass her. 
Speaking to reporters during his visit to the plot, Mr. Sudhakaran said she had been allotted the land by the Oommen Chandy government on her plea that she was not being allowed to live in her native village by the local CPI(M) and Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) workers. 
The reason cited for cancelling the allotment of the land was that Chithralekha owns a six-cent land at Edat, he said adding the land owned by her grandmother was transferred to her name for allowing her to take loan for buying an autorickshaw. 
“Ms. Chithralekha did not conceal this fact as her application for the land to the government mentioned that the six-cent land at Edat was in her name,” the Congress leader said. It was a gift deed executed by her grandmother without delivery of possession, he noted. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should intervene to ensure that the Dalit woman was allowed to live in peace by earning a living from her work, he said.",english

Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 6 (PTI) Kerala has built a model that identifies, nurtures and promotes talented innovations within the state unlike other states, which developed startup ecosystem by attracting talents from other geographies, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here today. ""We believe that such a strong ecosystem could also become a good nurturing ground for startups from other parts of India and the world,"" Vijayan said in his inaugural address at 'Huddle Kerala', one of Asias largest startup ecosystem congregations at nearby Kovalam. The two-day event is being organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) in association with Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IAMAI Startup Foundation. Kerala was the first state to come out with a startup policy, he said. In 2017, Kerala issued a policy document which specifically identified the interventions required to successfully develop new ventures in the state, he said. The state government observed youth entrepreneurship development as a key focus area, Vijayan said. The Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme outlined in the startup policy caters to developing technology, innovation and entrepreneurship among school and college students and aspiring professionals, he said. There were also programmes like training for startup CEOs and international exchange. All the schemes were available to the eligible startups through the incubation network facilitated by the KSUM. Currently, there are over 1,000 startups registered under the KSUM and the state has more than two lakh sq ft of incubation space available for startups, he said. For the last one year, the KSUM has funded 100 plus ideas which have potential to become successful ventures and create wealth and impact in the society. The government has provided innovation grants to these ideas to help them go to market and scale up faster. To make the investment available to the startups, a fund-of-fund programme has been created to invest in the startups operating from the state, the chief minister said. Within a short period of the launch of the scheme, several startups have benefited substantially from it, he said. Sharjah Digital Transformation Higher Committee Chairman Sheikh Fahim Bin Sultan Al Qasimi, who was the chief guest at the event, lauded the educational progress of Kerala in building up a strong startup ecosystem. M Sivasankar, Kerala IT Secretary, Harish Krishnan, Managing Diretor, Public Affairs and Strategic Engagements Cisco India and SAARC, Subho Ray, President, Internet and Mobile Association of India and Shrikant Sinha, CEO, NASSCOM, were among those present. 'Huddle Kerala offers a platform for startups to showcase their products and interact with a wide array of technology and industry leaders from around the world. Startups, investors, academicians and industry leaders are attending the event with a focus on the emerging sectors like blockchain, cryptocurrency, internet of things, gaming and e-sports, cyber security, digital entertainment, augmented reality, virtual reality, e-governance and mobile governance. Around 40 experts are slated to speak on these issues in 30 sessions. PTI UD RC Disclaimer: This story has not been edited by BW staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.

KOZHIKODE: The Pilikode grama panchayat in Kasargod has ushered in a revolution in saving electricity by switching over to LED from filament bulbs. It has become the first grama panchayat in the country to fully stop the use of filament lamps which led to the saving of 1,01,694 units of power worth Rs 4, 06, 776 per month between March 2016 and March 2017. As per the KSEB, 12, 20, 328 units of power worth over Rs 48 lakh will be saved annually.
This is the result of mission 'Oorjayanam' implemented by the panchayat in two phases during 2015-16 and 2016-17. As many as 6,116 households, 285 institutions and 166 pump houses were covered under the project and the panchayat is now free from incandescent lamps. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will make the declaration to this effect at Pilikode on April 12. The Energy Management Centre (EMC) in Thiruvananthapuram under department of power collaborated with the grama panchayat in the project. A total of 50 selected people were trained at the EMC initially.
""They trained the resource persons of 118 'Ayalkoottams' of Kudumbashree. A survey was conducted to know the power usage and the project implemented accordingly,"" said Pilikode grama panchayat president T.V. Sreedharan. LED lamps were supplied by EMC and KSEB at subsidised rates. People were taught to check power meter readings and regulate consumption. A 'power manager' was appointed among students and Ayalkoottams to monitor usage. Panchayat vice-president P. Shylaja said that follow-up action to switch over to solar energy and do away with induction cookers had been started.",english

BJP leaders believe they have much to celebrate, the party ruling 20 of the 31 state Assemblies besides being in power at the Centre is one of them.
It won Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, with a historic three-fourths majority. It also came to power for the first time ever in several states. Tripura in the North East is one state.
However, despite the expansion, the BJP faces a number of challenges in the years to come.
1. VICTORY IN FORTHCOMING ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS
Karnataka, which goes to polls in less than a month, poses an immediate challenge before the BJP. The Congress government of Siddaramaiah is giving the BJP trying times by raking up local issues such as declaring Lingayats as a separate religion, promoting Kannada, state flag and state anthem.
Assembly polls would be held in 10 states by the time 2019 Lok Sabha elections are held. The BJP would have the towering task of retaining all the five states (Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Sikkim) which it rules on its own or in alliance, and win the remaining Opposition-ruled five states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Mizoram, Odisha and Telangana).
2. LOK SABHA ELECTIONS
The BJP won 282 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections. The BJP-led NDA bagged a whopping 336 seats. In Uttar Pradesh alone, which has the maximum 80 seats, BJP was victorious on 71 seats.
It would be a major challenge for the party and its alliance to repeat or better its performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
3. WINNING THE VIRGIN STATES
The BJP has never ever won elections in six states - Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Odisha, Mizoram and West Bengal. The party is trying hard to get a foothold in these states.
The BJP put up a decent display in the local elections in Odisha, pushing the Congress to the third position for the first time ever.
It has thrown a spirited challenge to Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal and Pinarayi Vijayan-led Communist Party of India (Marxist) government in Kerala. It has been seen evincing interest in the affairs of AIADMK and getting close to actor Rajinikanth who is set to dabble in politics.
But coming to power in West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu would remain one of the toughest challenges for the BJP.
4. MAJORITY IN RAJYA SABHA
The BJP's strength in the 245-member Rajya Sabha rose to 69 after the last month's election while that of the Congress fell to 50.
However, a majority in the Council of States continues to elude the BJP-led NDA. The BJP would be in a position to reach anywhere near the majority mark of 123 only after 2020. Devoid of a majority, the party will remain handicapped in fulfilling some of its promises like enforcing laws such as Uniform Civil Code and revocation of Article 370 with regard to Jammu and Kashmir.
5. RAHUL GANDHI
Of late, Rahul Gandhi has adopted an aggressive style of campaigning against the BJP. Though the BJP won the Gujarat Assembly election last year, Rahul succeeded in pinning down the BJP below 100 seats in the 182-member Assembly.
While BJP president Amit Shah had set 'Mission 150', the party got only 99 seats. Rahul Gandhi's offensive highlighting the ""failures"" of the BJP government did harm the ruling party.
Rahul is likely to adopt the same strategy in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He poses a major challenge to the Modi government.
With the Modi government beset with challenges, the BJP has a tough task ahead of it for at least the next couple of years.
6. JOBS
Job creation still remains a far cry despite the Narendra Modi government being on the verge of completing four years in power. Instead of more job opportunities, thousands reportedly lost employment after demonetisation. Skill development has yet to show any tangible results.
7. ECONOMY
Modi-led NDA government's success in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections hinges to a large extent on the progress made on the economy front. The Opposition, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, has been trying to corner the Modi government over demonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The Opposition blames the Modi government for rendering thousands of traders jobless by resorting to demonetisation and implementing a ""flawed"" GST.
The prices of petroleum products are also on the higher side leading to inflation. The government would be hard pressed to tackle economy in the months to come.
The BJP-led NDA government cannot claim to have kept inflation under control. Prices even of some essential items are high. Housing, education and health continue to be costly for the middle and lower classes.
8. CORRUPTION
No major case of graft has come into light against the Modi government in these four years. However, the bank scams and the government's failure to stop diamond merchants Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi and Kingfisher owner Vijay Mallya from fleeing the country have certainly dented the government's image.
Money is still changing hands in the governments departments. The BJP is yet to fulfil its election promise of bringing back black money stashed in banks abroad.
9. LAW AND ORDER
The BJP governments at the Centre and in the states cannot boast of better law and order situation than the Opposition-ruled states. In Delhi itself, which comes under the Union Home ministry, crime rate is still high.
The BJP-ruled states are witnessing bouts of violence against Dalits and Muslims in the name of cow vigilantism. Cases of violence against women also remain high.
10. EMOTIVE ISSUES
Emotive issues such as cow slaughter, beef ban, triple talaq and Ram temple at Ayodhya seem to have acquired disproportionate space in political discourse because of the fringe elements. The BJP has failed to check the fringe elements from vitiating the atmosphere of the country.
On several occasions, discussions veer around these issues instead of the urgent existential ones such as development, governance, economy, jobs, growth and agrarian distress.

(PTI) 
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that as many as 77,569 people were given state jobs after the CPI-M led LDF government came to power in the state in 2016. The number of appointments and creation of new posts in the government services rose during the first 20 months of the present government, the chief minister said in his Facebook post. 
Out of the total jobs given, 64,982 candidates were issued appointment letters by Kerala State Public Service Commission (KSPSC) while 12,587 got jobs through Employment Exchange between May 25, 2016 and January 31, 2018, he said. Vijayan said during the first 20 months from May 18, 2011 to January 31, 2013 of the previous Congress -led regime, only 48,951 people had got the government jobs. 
Vigilance in reporting vacancies and filling the same has helped the state government provide more government jobs to eligible the candidates, Vijayan said. The timetable maintained by the Public Service Commission in conducting examinations and publishing rank lists also helped candidates in getting opportunities, he added.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will lay the foundation stone for the waste-to-energy plant, to be established on the Brahmapuram campus of the Kochi Corporation, on Monday. The function will be held at the Town Hall at 10 a.m. 
The civic body, State government, and GJ Eco Power, the agency which has won the bid for setting up the plant, had signed a tripartite agreement for executing the project. 
While the corporation will ensure supply of 300 tonnes of waste at the plant everyday, the firm will produce power from waste, and the power thus generated will be purchased by the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). 
According to the agreement, the corporation will pay ₹2 per unit of power produced at the plant (viability gap fund) if there is difference in power tariff fixed by the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission for purchase of power produced and the cost of power production. 
Any difference in the cost of power production exceeding ₹2 will have to be shouldered by the State government, said a communication issued by Mayor Soumini Jain. 
Incidentally, the reclamation of a paddy field for setting up the plant and the technology suggested had come under criticism from various quarters. Rs.25 crore received 
The civic body has already obtained ₹25 crore from the corporate social responsibility fund of Bharat Petroleum Company Limited to meet the viability gap fund, the communication said. 
Minister for Local Self Government K.T. Jaleel will preside over the meeting.

A United Democratic Front (UDF) delegation led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala visited Keezhattur on Sunday to declare solidarity with the agitators fighting against acquisition of their paddy land for highway development. 
Speaking to reporters, Mr. Chennithala said the Opposition would not remain a passive spectator if the government attempted to put down the agitation by the local people with use of force. The government stand that it would not hold talks with the agitators was grossly undemocratic. Its attempt to isolate the agitators of Keezhattur and brand them as anti-socials would only prove counter-productive, he added. 
The Opposition leader reminded the government that the agitators of Keezhattur were not against development. Their fear was about losing their farms. 
Explore alternatives 
What the government should do was to explore alternatives to the bypass project. 
If the government refused to do so and continued attacking the agitators, Keezhattur would turn out to be another Nandigram and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would meet the fate of former Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Mr. Chennithala said. 
The UDF delegation also comprised IUML legislature party leader M.K. Muneer, Abdul Khader Moulavi (IUML), George Vadakara (KC-Jacob), Illickal Augusthy (RSP), P.A. Zaheer (CMP), and Ram Mohan (FB). 
Visits Dalit woman 
The Leader of the Opposition also called on Chithralekha, the Dalit woman autorikshaw driver facing eviction from the piece of land allotted to her by the previous UDF government, at Eramangalam in Payyannur. 
In Malappuram 
Mr. Chennithala also visited the agitators at A.R. Nagar at Vengara in Malappuram and interacted with Shabeena who has been on a fast for the past eight days. 
He was accompanied by K.N.A. Khader, MLA; former Minister A.P. Anil Kumar; and UDF district chairman Ajay Mohanan.",english

TRIVANDRUM: Kerala’s Congress party-led opposition has spurned the state government’s invitation to discuss the fallout of regularising illegal admissions to two medical colleges.Governor P. Sathasivam had on Saturday rejected a controversial piece of legislation that they unanimously adopted to legalise 180 admissions made in 2016 after the supreme court questioned its sanctity.Following this, law minister AK Balan said the government would decide on what to do after holding discussions with the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) leaders.“There is no point in discussing it since both the governor and the apex court have rejected it citing legal issues,” opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala told reporters in Kannur on Sunday.“We supported the Bill considering the sad plight of many meritorious students. It’s now up to the government to find a solution.” He also asked the government to take a stern position against the petition of the private medical colleges in the high court seeking to quash the regulatory panel-fixed fee structure and demanding to double them.“The government’s self-defeatist policies are leaving students in limbo. They also allow the managers to plunder them,” he said.“The (Communist-led) government should end the hide-and-seek.”The earlier admission and fee regulatory committee appointed by the previous government cancelled the admissions as it found them flouting norms and collecting millions of rupees.The high court and the supreme court later refused to axe the order, prompting the government to issue an ordinance regularising them, which was last week made into legislation and sent to the governor for his signature.The government’s failure to protect the meritorious students for the past two years while allowing all of them to continue their studies and the opposition’s support to legalise an illegitimate act had drawn widespread criticism.Senior Congress leader Benny Behanan demanded the resignation of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan given the severe blow he suffered from the apex court. He also demanded a meeting of the Political Affairs Committee of the Congress party to discuss the issue since its credibility also had suffered a setback by backing the government.",english

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has resolved to work for consolidation of votes against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre by bringing together all like-minded, democratic and progressive forces. 
The party, however, is disinclined to take up any efforts to forge an alternative at the national level as its efforts to bring about a non-BJP and non-Congress political front over the last three decades did not yield desired results. The party had in fact suffered in the process as its primary focus rested on forging the alternative rather than strengthening the organisation from the grassroots level, CPI (M) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu said. 
“Weakening of the Left Front has several reasons with working for an alternative in the longer term being one among them,” he said. He asserted that though the party would concentrate all its efforts on ensuring the defeat of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, it was unlikely to have any understanding or alliance with the Congress. 
Mr. Raghavulu briefed reporters about the arrangements being made for the successful conduct of the party’s 22nd national congress in Hyderabad slated to commence on April 18. Over 850 delegates from across the country including Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and former Chief Ministers of Tripura and West Bengal would participate in the deliberations to finalise the stand that should be adopted in future. He said the BJP Government had ensured that the implementation of the liberalisation policies had become much deeper and faster ever since it took over, adversely affecting the workers, farmers and others from the unorganised sector. The party had therefore decided to intensify its efforts to consolidate the votes of these suffering in its fight against the policies of the BJP Government at the Centre. 
Replying to queries, he said the CPI (M) would consider alliances or understanding based on the principles and policies of other political parties as the party was firm that alliances would stick if they were based on clear understanding of the policies of the partnering parties. The CPI (M) had been insisting on broad-based electoral reforms paving the way for proportional representation as also steps to reduce the use of money in the election process.",english

EVERYONE WHO’S someone in politics wants his party to grow. There are two ways to achieve this: one, try it out through a media-led engagement with the public; two, take up people’s causes and through positive action, get people to swell the party’s ranks. The first is by far easy. All you need do is cultivate influence with the media to push your cause. The second path is arduous and painstaking. 
Arvind Kejriwal took the second route even before he entered politics. He served the poor through community work in Delhi’s slums, won a Magsaysay, and gained credibility. No one questions his commitment to the cause. Media helped him, though he never asked for it. By contrast, those who led the Indian left in recent decades opted for the easy route. Problem with this route is, its results might not last for long. Decades of deceitful behavior brought the Communists to a level where the left has, by now, turned out to be a near-total washout. The hypocrites who presided over the two Communist parties failed to earn people’s goodwill. So much so, the only hope to the left for survival today is outlying Kerala, the tiny state where it and the Congress alternate in power for the past many years. In the minimum, the leaders there have mass base and some credibility. 
Worldwide, Communist parties were known to be the ultimate refuge to the poor, the disadvantaged, the marginalised sections of the society. Or so it is understood, though it is increasingly being proven that the political philosophy of the left and its governing styles are not the way forward for social progress. As a political philosophy, it proved to be a disaster world-wide, and none other than Fidel Castro stated as much in the evening of his life. Where the Communists held power, societies failed to be upwardly mobile. Examples are not only Cuba and North Korea, but also the erstwhile Soviet Union, where too a stage came when hunger was the dominant worry for the masses by the 1980s. This resulted in the breakup of the nation, and Russia ultimately stopped yapping about Communism. Vietnam started progressing after it bid goodbye to Communism and joined hands with the Americans it once detested and fought. Notably, Communist leaders excelled in one thing everywhere in the world: being bluff-masters. As the adage goes, ‘You can fool some for some time; you can’t fool all the people for all the time’. 
Communist ideology has inherent problems. For, growth has a different dynamics, something that’s alien to Communism. Communists refuse to think out of the box, which is the prime requirement for societies to advance. At best, they can quote a few sentences from Das Kapital; or keep yapping against “imperialism”, “fascism”, and so on and so forth. Reason why they are a laughing stock in today’s societies. They have no interest in social development or human progress. They are characters of a kind. So with India too, as was evident in West Bengal as also Tripura. But, even the Communists could not undercut social progress in Kerala because of its inherent strengths; namely, the great roles played by Christian missionaries in the spread of education and health care; and the help from local Muslims to draw in large masses of people to the oil-rich Gulf region for jobs and business. Credit Kerala’s Christians also with the introduction of rubber, what was until recently a money-spinner that helped even small landholders earn enough to keep the family hearth burning. 
What Communists did in Kerala was to retard the process of growth. Had it not been for the Gulf, or for Mumbai or Chennai in the distant past, educated Keralites would have had little opportunity back home to get a job other than as school teacher or as government staff. There are very few industries in Kerala even today, thanks to the Communists’ obstructionist tactics and penchant for labour militancy. Funnily, a Pinarayi Vijayan sitting in the chief minister’s chair now understands as much. Calcutta – now Kolkata – had been treated to similar offensives by the Communists under Jyoti Basu, resulting in the fleeing of industrial units and gradual erosion of the city’s job opportunities. The unalloyed fact is that the Communist (or more specifically the Marxist) leaders have no understanding of the present; and they have no vision for the future. They are morons of a kind. 
Communism in India is an enterprise led by self-styled “intellectuals” with an elitist mindset. They sit in air-conditioned rooms, lead the life of elitists, and hijack the causes of the common man; the causes of serving the nation’s poor and the deprived ones. Their slogans are specially fashioned to catch the attention of the middle class, the urban, English-savvy crowds; so with Sitaram Yechury’s nasal intonations and JNU-English flowing from the party podiums. 
The sweat of the poor is alien to Indian Communists’ way of thinking. They are, rather, in the forefront to grant more benefits to the government servants – mostly comprising men as also women who take not only high salaries but also make money through questionable means, to end up being pensioners for life. Pinarayi Vijayan wants to introduce menstrual leave for women white collar workforce, as proposed by Brinda Karat. He might not propose the same for the labourers sweating it out in agriculture fields. He, by now, is part of the elitists’ club. The Adivasis or tribals, or the Dalits who struggle in their lives are not in the Communists’ mental orbit. Even ageing former CM, VS Achuthanandan. did no more than lip-service to the cause of the poor. 
In Tripura, the obsession of the CPI(M), true to its class character, was to ensure the well-being of the migrant Bengali and Assamese communities, mostly those who man the government and live in comfort; but with just marginal interest shown to the native tribals and their causes. BJP caught on this, worked its way through tribal hamlets, and tightened the screw on the CPI(M). Will it suffice to say a Manik Sarkar has no house of his own, or walked/cycled his way to office, or has just a few penny as bank balance? What did he do to improve the lot of the poor, the tribals, when he had a lifetime’s opportunity? Instead, as a hard-core Bengali, he pandered to the educated, well-heeled Bengalis’ interests. No industry, no jobs, and no welfare measure other than a literacy drive! Communists get great kick in organising literacy drives, for there is a spark of elitism involved in it. 
Across India, fact is that the Communists neither tried to understand the plight of the ordinary masses nor tried to come up with a helping hand. English media has been a fertile ground for their verbal and ideological acrobatics, big talks, and foolish assumptions and arguments. Fact is also that the poor had never been in the Indian Communists’ scheme of things after the first jab of land reforms in Kerala, followed by West Bengal. Inertia crept in; power loosened their ideological grip; and the goodies that democracy offered became their main obsession. Decadence set in. The cause of the poor suffered at the hands of these charlatans. 
Communists in India are the main upholders of elitist obsessions like democracy, freedom of thought, fundamental rights of citizens, and right to protest in the streets. Do governments allow all these in Russia and China? Why not extend their campaign to these countries too? 
Fighting the government at the Centre, be it the Congress in the past or the BJP at present, has been the Communists’ favourite obsession. Result, hardly any major project came to Kerala, West Bengal or Tripura for the past many years or decades. They are coming up by the dozens every month in other states. The members these three states sent to Parliament perpetually sat on Opposition benches, disrupted parliament, and failed to promote the interests of the state through liaising with various ministries. Sitaram Yechury was in the forefront of the obstructions to parliamentary proceedings in Rajya Sabha until his term ended recently. His target: Narendra Modi, a lowly tea-seller’s son who fashioned himself as PM. The three states’ interests suffered because of the leftists. Mamata Banerjee does the same, fighting the Centre, and with the same result. Bengal’s progress suffered again. Not many have understood the harm these cynics have done on these states. Contrast this with the development in states like, for instance, Tamil Nadu. Every Union Government has had the involvement of either the DMK or the AIADMK, and their ministers worked for the state’s growth. The people were benefited. 
The obsession of Communist leaders like EMS Namboodiripad was to teach a lesson or two to the outside world, and not to learn from the happenings around the globe. Communists always played a negative role in Kerala’s growth, though some positive contributions from some individual leaders in various governments – like the introduction of a civil supplies system that guaranteed sale of essential items at reasonable prices through government stores by CPI’s late E Chandrasekharan Nair — cannot be lost sight of. After that, this highly corrupt party kept Nair in a corner! The foreign countries the Communist leaders visited in the past were Romania, Cuba, Soviet Union and the like – nations that have nosedived in the matter of social and economic progress. If ever they took a lesson or two from abroad, they did from those nations of the past. China saved itself by bidding goodbye to ideology, adapting itself to some capitalist ideals, and adopting market economy as the prop for progress; and with impressive results. What of Cuba and North Korea? 
Sitaram Yechury, a product of student activism in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), or his predecessor Prakash Karat, spent almost their entire post-education life in the party office in New Delhi. Both are self-styled theoreticians but have had little of time or opportunities to understand the ground realities or the plight of the poor. They are the anti-thesis of an Arvind Kejriwal. Yechury’s present obsession has been to “set things right” in the Kerala unit of the party, which by far is the only party unit that retains some zest and public appeal. A week before the Tripura election disaster for the party, he made a statement at the Kerala CPI(M) state conference: “Mind you, the CPI(M) is not Communist Party of Kerala (Marxist), it is a national party, it decides on matters at the national level.” The warning: If you do not want an alliance with the Congress, don’t say there should be no alliance at the national level. 
For sure, Kerala’s peculiar situations would give the CPI(M) a longer lease of life. BJP can win anywhere, but not in Kerala, because about half the population comprises Christians (18 per cent) and Muslims (28 per cent). They are solid anti-BJP vote banks. Hindus, split between the Ezhavas, Dalits and Nairs in that numerical order of population strengths, are a deeply divided house. Getting them together in BJP is next to impossible. The two Communist parties are populated almost exclusively with Hindus. Brahmins are fewer in number in Kerala. Big question is, where will the BJP get its votes from, in a communally divided state? In this scenario where minorities hold the trump card, no BJP strategy works; not even the installation of an Alphonse Kannamthanam as Union minister. He can be of help in liaising with the Church leaders outside the state, though. Christians in Kerala are in no mood to suffer the BJP; just as Muslims are not. The dynamics of religion in the North-East is different and hence the BJP won the votes there. 
The Congress in Kerala is steadily losing whatever support it had; and the BJP is the gainer in a small way. So far, the Congress rode piggyback on the strength of two communal outfits: the ‘Kerala Congress’ parties that drew their support from various sects of Christians; and the Muslim League that had equally strong support from Muslims. The strength of the UDF is essentially the strength of the KC groups and the Muslim League. The strongest KC group, led by KM Mani that had recently quit the UDF, is toying with the idea of an alliance with the Left, after it lost its initial enthusiasm last year to be in the BJP camp. Mani found out that if the party allied with the BJP, it would lose its mass base. So, why take a risk, he asked his partymen. 
Communism might survive in Kerala for a while more. But, worse, there are death knells being sounded on the two parties –CPI(M) and CPI — on the trade union front everywhere, and mostly outside of Kerala. When it comes to trade unionism, Communist trade unionists raised their heads in placid waters and took the safe route with no serious commitment to the blue collar workers’ causes; here now are choppy waters on all sides. 
BJP, through its BMS, is aggressively cutting the left trade unions to size in city after city. So far, the leftist unions ruled the roost, be they in the railways, the ports, the postal sphere, or in industries. INTUC was losing its strength over the years and didn’t mind yielding ground to the reds. Now, the BMS is increasingly gaining strength and left unions are being hijacked overnight to the saffron side, lock stock and barrel. So, the new left strategy: look out for new pastures, make a ‘bakra’ out of farmers (as they did from Nasik, Maharashtra, the only constituency that elected a CPI(M) member in the last assembly polls.) A specially deputed Keralite, and no Maharashtrian, was at hand to organise the farmers and lead them in a rally to Mumbai! 
Little wonder, then, that the two Communist parties are at their wits’ end; and the struggle for survival requires of them to stand united. Divided they stand, united they fall. Neither a rootless wonder like Sudhakar Reddy nor Sitaram Yechury desires a disaster for the left.

The matter will be discussed at a day-long meeting, to be held in the state capital on Tuesday, in which ministers and officials from the other states would also participate. The policy of sharing central funds with states was hitherto done based on the 1971 census. Now the 2011 census will be taken, and if that happens, Kerala -- as well as a few south Indian states -- would be the worst affected as our population growth was just 56 per cent as compared to 150 per cent in certain states in the country. If 2011 is going to be used, Kerala will lose Rs 20,000 crore in five years, while Tamil Nadu stands to lose Rs 40,000 crore, said Issac. All BJP-ruled states -- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh -- will gain, he added. Issac said the states should be given the freedom to decide on what they need and not be dictated to. We have no issues regarding the composition of the 15th FC as we do not wish to take on personalities. Instead, we should be given the freedom to decide what we need, the economist-turned-politician said. When I spoke to my counterparts in south India, all of them, with the exception of Telangana, have confirmed their participation in the day-long meeting to be held here tomorrow, he added. The meeting would be inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Every state will be allowed to present their case and, at the end of the day, there could well be a joint communique, said Issac. Issac added that, hitherto, it was the Planning Commission that decided on the state's share from the central pool with regards to allocation under the plan expenditure, while the FC dealt with non-plan expenditure. Now that the Planning Commission does not exist, everything is clubbed into one figure -- including grants given by the Centre; then saying the state's overall share has grown from 32 per cent till now to 42 per cent, is misleading. Also it's not right for the FC to determine populist schemes, as it's the right of the state government; it's a political decision that has to be taken while determining populist schemes, added Issac. Echoing similar fears was the Kochi-based Centre for Socio-economic and Environmental Studies, whose head K.K. George said that the turf of the constitutional body had been encroached upon to a large extent by the Planning Commissions in the past and off late by the Niti Aayog. The fault for allowing this encroachment lies partly with the successive Finance Commissions, which abdicated their constitutional responsibilities and limited their roles, on their own, presumably in tune with the wishes of the central government. This is particularly so in the case of the present FC. There is no representative in FC15 who is familiar with state finances. All of them, except one, are connected with central government bodies like the Niti Aayog, said George, adding that the major gainers if Census 2011 is used would be Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. --IANS",english

He was the first one to support party MLA V T Balram, who had opposed the medical admission regulatory bill aimed at regularising the admissions. 

Alleging graft to the tune of several crores, Behanan, in a statement on Sunday, said: ""It has also come to the notice of officials that both colleges accepted capitation fee. Though it was found out by the admission supervisory committee and bureaucrats, the information was suppressed by the government. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had taken personal interest in bringing out the legislation to regularise the admissions. Only an independent probe can reveal the corrupt dealings behind the act."" 

However, Behanan's demand has put the Congress in a fix as all, except one, legislators of the party had supported the controversial bill when it was tabled in the assembly. While senior leader Pandalam Sudhakaran slammed Behenan, K Muraleedharan appealed to all leaders not to worsen the issue. 

Interestingly, Behanan was backed by KPCC former president V M Sudheeran, who demanded the resignation of Pinarayi Vijayan, in the wake of the governor withholding his assent to the bill on Saturday. 

Senior Congress leader A K Antony also supported the minority in the party who are against the lobby of senior leaders including Oommen Chandy, M M Hassan and Ramesh Chennithala, who still feel that party's support to the bill was right. Youth Congress president Deen Kuriakode and KSU president K M Abhijeet have also opposed the party backing the bill. 

Last Friday, Congress MLAs K S Sabarinathan and Roji M John had come out against their colleague Balram for objecting to the bill. They had even claimed that Balram's act was merely aimed at garnering 'likes and applauses'.",english

The withholding of a bill is the first such instance in the history of Kerala legislature, and as there is no precedent as even the senior officials in the assembly secretariat are groping in the dark about the future course of action. 

""The validity of the current bill is over as the governor chose the withhold option under article 200 of the Constitution. It is for the government to decide whether to replace the bill with a new one, pass it in the assembly and send it for the assent of the governor,"" said a senior official. When the assembly meets next, the speaker will officially inform the house about the governor's decision. If the government decides not to press for the bill, that will be the end of story. 

Another senior official said there was an apparent injustice in the governor's act. ""Whatever may be the merit, the governor as the head of state should have approved the bill. It was passed unanimously by the assembly and that reflected the will of people. The governor should use his discretionary power judiciously and not based on personal preferences,"" said the official on condition of anonymity. 

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and CPM state secretariat prefer to wait till the Supreme Court considers the case next month. A section of students will approach the court for impleading in the case. If the court accepts their argument and suggests a solution, at least in case of students who had applied through proper channel, that will give a leeway to the government to do something to help the students and save its face. 

The opposition, which is facing a revolt from within for supporting the controversial bill, began taking steps to detach itself from the case . ""There is no relevance in holding any discussion with the government as the Supreme Court and governor have pointed out serious legal flaws. The opposition had supported the bill seeing the plight of 180 students,"" said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. 

Minister A K Balan said the government would decide after consulting the opposition. The cabinet would also seek the opinion of the law secretary and advocate general before discussing the governor's act.",english

Updated: April 9, 2018, 4:22 PM IST File photo of Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac. Thiruvananthapuram: The crucial meeting of the ministers of the southern states will take place in Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday over alleged diversion of tax revenues for the development of north Indian states. Kerala Finance Minister, Thomas Issac, said, “Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy, Tamil Nadu Deputy CM O Panneerselvam and Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu will take part in the meet,” said Issac. The meeting will begin at 10am with an address by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The escalation in friction over division of funds comes after the central government's recommendation to the 15th Finance Commission of using population data from the 2011 Census, instead of the 1971 Census, for distribution of central tax revenues. Issac said the terms of reference is an attack on federal structure and it is undemocratic. “If the population criteria is the 2011 Census, there is a very significant loss for southern states. Between 1971 and 2011, our population has only increased by 56% .In some of Hindi heartland states, population has increased by more than 150 %,” he said, adding that the formula would give 80% - 85% weightage to the backward states. “This is more like a backwardness formula. We want it to give weightage to efficiency too,” he said. The minister also said that it is undemocratic for Finance Commission to be deciding on ""disincentivising populist programmes."" He added that it is difficult to say exactly how much will be the loss. “If we keep the other parameters of the 14th finance commission and just change the census for Kerala, the loss in allocation will be about Rs 20,000 crore. For Tamil Nadu, it will be around Rs 40,000 crore,” Issac added. Issac said that he wants to play down the political overtones as this is an issue that is seriously affecting the southern states. Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu was the first to rake up the issue. “There is nothing called Centre’s or State’s money. It is the taxpayer’s money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre but they are diverting the money to the development of the North,” said Naidu. Siddaramaiah told News18 that Karnataka contributes nearly 10 percent of the overall Central revenue, yet the state gets back only five percent of the redistributed funds. “I endorse the opinion of the Andhra CM. Karnataka contributes 9.56 percent to the overall Centre in revenues but it gets back just around 4.5 percent,” he said, adding that the South was being wronged. Also Watch",english

Kerala's finance minister called terms of reference in the 15th finance commission undemocratic. Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda will represent his state at the conclave. 
In a move expected to fuel the North-South divide regarding the proposed terms of reference in the 15th Finance Commission Bill, Kerala will host a conclave of finance ministers from south Indian states. 
The conclave will be hosted in the backdrop of the terms of reference in the 15th finance commission to use 2011 census data as the benchmark for the allocation of funds from the Centre. 
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the conclave on Tuesday. 
Kerala finance minister Dr TM Thomas Isaac said the ministers from Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh have confirmed their attendance. Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and minister for fisheries D Jayakumar is expected to represent Tamil Nadu in the crucial meeting. 
Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda and Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu will represent their states. Though Telangana has been invited, it is yet to confirm its presence at the conclave, said Isaac. 
Elaborating on the reference topics to be taken up at the ministers' meet, Isaac said that the terms of reference in the 15th finance commission is undemocratic and it's an attack on the federal structure. 
""The terms of reference should not compel the commission to discard our concerns that will be raised in the memorandum. If population is used as a criteria on the 2011 census, there will be a significant loss to all south Indian states along with Haryana and Odisha in the north. From 1971 to 2011 the population in Kerala has grown by only 56 per cent. But there are some north Indian states where the population has grown by over 150 per cent. 80 - 85 per cent (sic) weightage of the formula will go towards backward states. This is more like a backwardness formula. We want it to give weightage to efficiency too,"" Isaac said. 
""The review committee has recommended the fiscal deficit for states to be reduced to 1.7 per cent. This is totally unacceptable and will make everything go haywire. It's undemocratic for the finance commission to be deciding on disincentivising populist programmes,"" Issac said.",english

He was the first one to support party MLA V T Balram, who had opposed the medical admission regulatory bill aimed at regularising the admissions.
Alleging graft to the tune of several crores, Behanan, in a statement on Sunday, said: ""It has also come to the notice of officials that both colleges accepted capitation fee. Though it was found out by the admission supervisory committee and bureaucrats, the information was suppressed by the government. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had taken personal interest in bringing out the legislation to regularise the admissions. Only an independent probe can reveal the corrupt dealings behind the act.""
However, Behanan's demand has put the Congress in a fix as all, except one, legislators of the party had supported the controversial bill when it was tabled in the assembly. While senior leader Pandalam Sudhakaran slammed Behenan, K Muraleedharan appealed to all leaders not to worsen the issue.
Interestingly, Behanan was backed by KPCC former president V M Sudheeran, who demanded the resignation of Pinarayi Vijayan, in the wake of the governor withholding his assent to the bill on Saturday.
Senior Congress leader A K Antony also supported the minority in the party who are against the lobby of senior leaders including Oommen Chandy, M M Hassan and Ramesh Chennithala, who still feel that party's support to the bill was right. Youth Congress president Deen Kuriakode and KSU president K M Abhijeet have also opposed the party backing the bill.
Last Friday, Congress MLAs K S Sabarinathan and Roji M John had come out against their colleague Balram for objecting to the bill. They had even claimed that Balram's act was merely aimed at garnering 'likes and applauses'.",english

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has urged the Centre to freeze the terms of reference (ToR) of the 15th Union Finance Commission (UFC), which he said, tends to restrict the commission’s freedom to discharge its constitutional obligation and threatens to reduce the fiscal leeway of the States. 
Dr. Isaac told reporters here on Monday that Finance Ministers of the southern States would converge here on Tuesday to deliberate the impact of the ToR “that go against the spirit of federalism and deprive the States of the freedom to initiate major development initiatives. The State is not against the composition of the commission or its members, but it has serious concerns about the ToR that tend to penalise the States that have made commendable effort in addressing backwardness and also implementing birth control measures,” he said. 
“The ToR drawn up in a arbitrary manner should be frozen and the suggestions of the States should be given due weightage. The proposal to use the 2011 census as the basic data for devolving 30% resources to the States would amount to penalisation of States such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu that have effectively curbed population growth and addressed social, educational and economic backwardness,” he said. 
The commission’s brief includes a review of the popular welfare programmes initiated by State governments. The BJP was using the commission to enforce its political agenda to do away with programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme that it does not approve, he said. 
It has also been tasked to review the continuance of the grant given to the States for reining in revenue deficit at a time when the gap between revenue deficit and expenditure of States was widening. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act review committee has recommended to fix the fiscal deficit of the Centre at 2.5% and that of States at 1.7%. This would again shrink the fiscal space of the States and development projects would be affected, he said. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would inaugurate the meeting in the morning. Ministers and senior officials would discuss issues concerning the ToR at the day-long meeting. Ministers of all States, except Telangana have confirmed their participation at the meeting, he said.",english

Talking to reporters, Kerala finance minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the changes in the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission, that would adversely affect the southern states, has not become a debate in the country. 
“The objective of the conference was to highlight the issue and make it a national agenda for debate”, Isaac said. Slamming the Centre, he said the ToR was against the federal co-operative structure of the country. “We will not allow to destroy the federal co-operative structure of the nation,” he said. 
The ToR has recommended using the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous finance commissions. This would adversely affect the southern states, he said. 
There was uncertainty over the incentives to be given to states, he said. There were several issues that have to be discussed at the national level. The meeting would be a first step towards that, he said. 
The Centre should provide freedom to the 15th Finance Commission to hear the states, Isaac said. Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry has confirmed participation in the conference, which would be inaugurated by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, he said.

Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac has persuaded other southern states to join hands against the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) that are seen as hampering the prospects of states that have kept a check on population growth. 
The matter will be discussed at a day-long meeting, to be held in the state capital on Tuesday, in which ministers and officials from the other states would also participate. 
""The policy of sharing central funds with states was hitherto done based on the 1971 census. Now the 2011 census will be taken, and if that happens, Kerala – as well as a few south Indian states – would be the worst affected as our population growth was just 56 per cent as compared to 150 per cent in certain states in the country.” 
""If 2011 is going to be used, Kerala will lose Rs 20,000 crore in five years, while Tamil Nadu stands to lose Rs 40,000 crore,"" said Issac. All BJP-ruled states – Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh – will gain, he added. 
Issac said the states should be given the freedom to decide on what they need and not be dictated to. 
""We have no issues regarding the composition of the 15th FC as we do not wish to take on personalities. Instead, we should be given the freedom to decide what we need,"" the economist-turned-politician said. 
""When I spoke to my counterparts in south India, all of them, with the exception of Telangana, have confirmed their participation in the day-long meeting to be held here tomorrow,"" he added. 
The meeting would be inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. ""Every state will be allowed to present their case and, at the end of the day, there could well be a joint communique,"" said Issac. 
Issac added that, hitherto, it was the Planning Commission that decided on the state's share from the central pool with regards to allocation under the plan expenditure, while the FC dealt with non-plan expenditure. 
""Now that the Planning Commission does not exist, everything is clubbed into one figure – including grants given by the Centre; then saying the state's overall share has grown from 32 per cent till now to 42 per cent, is misleading.” 
""Also it's not right for the FC to determine populist schemes, as it's the right of the state government; it's a political decision that has to be taken while determining populist schemes,"" added Issac. 
Echoing similar fears was the Kochi-based Centre for Socio-economic and Environmental Studies, whose head K.K. George said that the turf of the constitutional body had been encroached upon to a large extent by the Planning Commissions in the past and off late by the NITI Aayog. 
""The fault for allowing this encroachment lies partly with the successive Finance Commissions, which abdicated their constitutional responsibilities and limited their roles, on their own, presumably in tune with the wishes of the central government.” 
""This is particularly so in the case of the present FC. There is no representative in FC15 who is familiar with state finances. All of them, except one, are connected with central government bodies like the Niti Aayog,"" said George, adding that the major gainers if Census 2011 is used would be Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of implementing an upper caste Hindutva agenda in the country, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president M.M. Hassan has said that the CPI(M) in the State is no different from the BJP in oppressing the Dalits. 
Inaugurating a protest organised by the district Congress leadership here in solidarity with the party’s nationwide fast on Monday to promote social harmony and protest against the alleged dilution of the Scheduled Caste-Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, Mr. Hassan said that Dalits in the country were being targeted after the BJP came to power. 
Many welfare schemes were being denied to the Dalits, he added. 
The KPCC president also said that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was also no different from the BJP in persecuting the Dalits. 
The Left Democratic Front government’s decision to cancel five cents allotted to Dalit autorikshaw driver Chitralekha here by the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government was the latest example of the CPI(M)’s vendetta against her, Mr. Hassan said. 
Terming the cancellation of the land allotment as inhuman and unjust, he said the CPI(M) was expelling Ms. Chitralekha from her land. 
He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan were competing in hounding the Dalits. 
K.C. Joseph, MLA, Congress leader K. Sudhakaran, KPCC vice president Lali Vincent, treasurer Johnson Abraham, KPCC general secretaries Shooranad Rajashekharan, K.P. Kunhikannan, Sajeev Joseph, V.A. Narayanan, spokesman Rajmohan Unnithan, party leader P. Ramakrishnan, and district Congress president Satheeshan Pacheni were among those present.",english

“The government is committed to materialising the national waterway in the State,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
He was launching a rescue-cum-ambulance boat service of the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) at Panavally, near here, on Monday. 
“We have 1,700 km of waterways in the State. The government has constituted a special purpose vehicle to create a national waterway. It will boost the commercial prospects of central Kerala,” the Chief Minister said. 
According to officials, the high-speed rescue-cum-ambulance boat (rescue and dive boat) will serve multiple purposes. The boat can be used for rescue missions in case of emergency in the waterbodies. Further, it will serve as a medical rescue boat for people living on islands. The water ambulance will help people with emergency medical conditions to be shifted to a hospital without delay. 
Officials said there would be a dedicated mobile number and the boat would rush to the spot upon getting alerts. The service would be made available 24x7. 
22 passengers 
Besides the crew, each vessel can accommodate 22 passengers. The boats have a design speed of 12 knots instead of the normal boat speed of six knots. The boats have been fitted with all basic equipment for rescue missions along with medical facilities. 
The SWTD will launch four such boats which will be stationed at Alappuzha, Muhamma, Ernakulam, and Vaikom. 
The Chief Minister also inaugurated a boat station of the SWTD at Panavally. Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran presided over the function.",english

The processing of waste at source had turned out to be a tough task in cities like Kochi, and the government was forced to go in for centralised processing plants, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
Speaking after laying the foundation stone for the waste-to-energy plant to be set up at Brahmapuram, Mr. Vijayan said the State needed to adopt a new culture of cleanliness. 
The government has plans to set up waste management plants in all corporations and three municipalities. The piling up of waste in municipal areas have resulted in health hazards. Diseases that were hitherto unknown to the State too have emerged, he said. 
The government is committed to protecting the environment, and the new plant will be an eco-friendly one. The piled-up waste at the Brahmpauram plant site will also be used for generating power from the new plant, the Chief Minister added. 
The setting up of the plant also marks a change in the atmosphere of the State. The decision to set up the plant was taken after addressing concerns raised by various quarters. It will also evolve as a model for the State, he hoped. 
Minister for Local Self Government K.T. Jaleel presided over the inaugural function.

Photo: PTI Bengaluru: Kerala’s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) have been criticized after they passed a bill with near unanimous approval in the legislative assembly last week, seeking to regularize controversial medical admissions in two private colleges. 
The Kerala Professional Colleges (Regulation and Admission in Medical Colleges) Bill 2017 was passed on Wednesday, mainly to benefit about 180 students of the 2016-17 batch at Kannur Medical College and Karuna Medical College, whose admissions had been cancelled by two official panels, as well as the Medical Council of India, Kerala high court and Supreme Court.
Kerala governor P. Sathasivam returned the bill without approval on Saturday, putting both political fronts in a spot. The governor withheld his assent because of a Supreme Court ruling on Thursday that upheld an earlier Kerala high court order, where the admissions were cancelled because of the flawed manner in which they were conducted. The Supreme Court came down heavily on the state government saying it was trying to subvert the court by passing legislation, and stayed an ordinance which led to the bill. 
The series of developments has prompted severe criticism against both fronts, both from within and outside. The ruling communists, who had battled it out on the streets in the past to oppose unfair practices in private medical colleges, are questioned about the hurried regularization of admissions which the admission supervisory committee had cancelled.
“Is there any connection between what we said in the past and what we did now?” asked K.V. Vasu, father of the late communist icon Roshan, in a Facebook post in Malayalam on Sunday, which was widely shared by many and also picked up by regional media houses. 
In the Congress camp, senior leader A.K. Anthony and former state president V.M. Sudheeran flayed the leadership for supporting the bill in the house. 
On Sunday, another senior leader Benny Behnan alleged that the whole development smacks of large-scale corruption and should be probed. 
V.T. Balram, the sole Congress member who opposed the bill, has also become a polarizing figure. He was criticized by a section of the party leaders, but praised by many on social media.
The setbacks have also made the future of the bill uncertain. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said his government does not want to pick a fight with the Supreme Court, suggesting the bill would be freezed to prevent further legal setbacks. The future course of actions, Vijayan said on Saturday after the governor returned the bill, will be discussed after further talks with the opposition. 
However, on Sunday, Congress made it clear that it is not keen on supporting the bill any longer. 
“Since the Supreme Court and the Governor had pointed out the legal issues concerning the Bill, further dialogue with the state government does not have any relevance,” Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said in a statement on Sunday night.

The Rs 295 crore plant would be constructed in two phases and a plant to process the garbage and produce refuse derived fuel (RDF), which is in the form of bricks would be set up in the first phase.
As per the schedule, the construction of the first phase of the project, which is to treat garbage will be completed by January 2019. In the second phase, the gasification plant to generate energy from the RDF will be constructed.
In February, Kochi corporation had handed over 20 acres in Brahmapuram to GJ Eco Power Private Ltd for construction of the plant. ""We have completed all the procedures to be completed by us. The remaining processes including securing various approvals are to be done by the government,"" said V K Minimol, chairperson, standing committee for health.
The project is yet to get the clearances from the agencies like pollution control board and environmental clearance. Though around 20 acres earmarked for the project was wetland where construction is not allowed, the government gave exemption to it. The construction of the project designed in 2015 had been stuck in controversies and lack of various clearances. The total cost of the project, which will generate 10 MW of electricity, is Rs 295 crore. The promoters of the project envisage that 85% of the total revenue can be generated from electricity produced at the plant.

ധനകാര്യ കമ്മിഷന്റെ പരിഗണനാവിഷയങ്ങൾ രാജ്യത്തെ ഫെഡറൽ തത്വങ്ങൾക്കു വിരുദ്ധമാണെന്നും ഇതുസംബന്ധിച്ചു വേണ്ടത്ര ചർച്ചയോ സംവാദമോ ഉയർന്നുവരാത്ത ഘട്ടത്തിലാണ് ഇത്തരമൊരു യോഗം സംഘടിപ്പിക്കാൻ കേരളം മുൻകയ്യെടുത്തതെന്നും മന്ത്രി ടി.എം.തോമസ് ഐസക്. പറഞ്ഞു. ധനകാര്യ കമ്മിഷനെ മറയാക്കി രാജ്യത്തെ ഫെഡറൽ നിമയങ്ങൾ പൊളിച്ചെഴുതാനാണു കേന്ദ്രസർക്കാർ ശ്രമിക്കുന്നതെന്നും അത് അനുവദിക്കില്ലെന്നും ഐസക് പറഞ്ഞു.

(Photo: DC) Kochi: Effective and consistent efforts have helped the government initiate the Brahmapuram waste-to-energy plant despite widespread apprehensions over its feasibility, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday. While laying the foundation stone for the much-delayed plant, he said it was being set up after clearing the concerns of the local community and protecting interests of the Kochi Corporation.
His scientific advisor M.C. Dathan had played a crucial role in clearing apprehensions and doubts over its feasibility. “When the project got stuck even in the initial stage, he has been asked to study it in detail and recommend practical solutions. He held several rounds of talks and made necessary changes in the agreement with the company,” he said.
“The Brahmapuram plant will be a role model for the state. Steps are afoot to set up centralised waste treatment plants in five city corporations and three municipalities.” The government has handed over 20 acres of land to GJ Eco Power Limited, the company setting up the plant, on a contract basis. The plant will be functional in 18 months.
“Though treating waste at source is ideal in big cities like Kochi, the concept is not fully practical. Hence, the government has decided to set up the plant to address the issue of piled up waste causing infectious diseases. Waste will be heated using gasification process, and the thermal energy will be converted to electrical power,” he said.
The plant will be set up at a cost of Rs 375 crore, and the company will run it for 15 years. Nearly 500 units of electricity can be generated from one tonne of garbage. With a capacity of treating 300 tonnes of waste, the plant can produce 5 to 6 MW of power per day.",english

Thiruvananthapuram: Finance ministers of the southern states would meet in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday at a conference convened by Kerala to discuss the concerns and views on the Terms of Reference of the 15th Finance Commission. 
Talking to reporters, Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac said the changes in the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the 15th Finance Commission, that would adversely affect the southern states, has not become a debate in the country. File image of Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac. News18 
""The objective of the conference was to highlight the issue and make it a national agenda for debate"", Isaac said. 
Slamming the Centre, he said the ToR was against the federal co-operative structure of the country. 
""We will not allow to destroy the federal co-operative structure of the nation', he said. 
The ToR has recommended using the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions. 
This would adversely affect the southern states, he said. 
There was uncertainty over the incentives to be given to states, he added. 
There were several issues that have to be discussed at the national level. The meeting would be a first step towards that, Isaac said. 
The Centre should provide freedom to the 15th Finance Commission to hear the states, he said. 
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry has confirmed participation in the conference, which would be inaugurated by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, he said.

Since the early 1950s, Finance Commissions have been tasked with working out the distribution of taxes between the Centre and states. This is done based on several factors, including fiscal capacity and discipline, area, fiscal distance from top-ranking states and most importantly, population. 
The 15th Finance Commission, constituted in November 2015, has proposed making recommendations based on population data from the 2011 census — till the 14th Finance Commission, recommendations were made according to 1971 data.

Kerala will host a conference of finance ministers and secretaries of southern states and Puducherry in Thiruvananthapuram, on Tuesday, in an effort to build consensus regarding the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the 15th Finance Commission.
Kerala Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac said here on Monday that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu have confirmed representation in the meeting. Sources in the minister's office said Telangana would not send a representative.
Isaac reiterated that the commission's ToR are undemocratic and in conflict with the federal structure. Through the meeting, the participants are trying to address concerns about the formula adopted in distribution of central funds and mobilise a national debate on the matter.
The conference will be inaugurated by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Representatives will speak during the inaugural session and, later, present their position on six themes identified as central to the conference.
Isaac has already raised concerns over the Finance Commission considering the 2011 population census to base its ToR, a move that adversely impacts the southern states which attained considerable progress in taking up family planning measures. ""Between 1971 and 2011, the population in Kerala has increased by 56% while the rise in northern states including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh has been over 150%,"" he said.
Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda and Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanaswamy are expected to participate in the meeting. ""From Tamil Nadu, instead of the finance minister, (Minister for Personnel and Administrative Reforms) D Jayakumar will attend,"" a source in the finance minister's office told DH.
The conference themes also cover Goods and Services Tax, release of grants to states and incentives to states based on populist schemes.
Isaac said he was not questioning assistance to states based on their social backwardness but said it could not be the sole criterion. ""We have nothing against the commission or its composition; our concerns are about the terms of reference that prevent it from providing space for a fair discussion,"" the minister said.",english

Officials from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry will attend the meeting, which will be inaugurated by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Officials from Telangana will skip the meeting, and it is unlikely that Tamil Nadu will attend. Kerala Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac said the new formula, which will adversely affect southern states, has not become a debate in the country. “We will not allow to destroy the federal co-operative structure of the nation,” he was quoted as saying by news agency. South Indian states have raised concerns over a new population-based formula for tax sharing between the Centre and states. The 15th Finance Commission, constituted in November 2017, has recognised population as an important criteria for distribution of taxes and said it will use data from the 2011 census while making recommendations for the five-year period beginning from 2020. The southern states, however, want the recommendations to be based on 1971 census data. This is because, as compared to northern states, south India has recorded significant progress in population control or in the replacement rate of population growth. 2018-04-10 Finance Ministers from South India to meet today over 15th Finance Commission   10 .

The crucial meeting of the ministers of the southern states is underway in Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram to discuss the concerns and views on the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the 15th Finance Commission. However, Tamil Nadu, Telangana has pulled out of today's meeting. Thomas Isaac 
The meeting has been organised by Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac in Thiruvananthapuram after the southern states opposed the latest terms of reference (ToR), which they claim will cut their share in revenues while benefitting the Centre with a bigger slice of the pie. 
Talking to reporters, Kerala finance minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the changes in the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission, that would adversely affect the southern states, has not become a debate in the country.

On April 28, Kerala will get its first shadow cabinet. It is being set up by members of civil society to critically analyse the policies and functioning of the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government.
A shadow cabinet is an institution popular in western democracies by which an opposition party forms an alternative cabinet with the aim of monitoring government decisions. The positions in shadow cabinets usually mirror those in the government. For instance, there would be shadow ministers who specialise in finance, education and home affairs. In Kerala, however, the Opposition Congress is not involved in the initiative. Instead, non-governmental organisations and social and environmental activists will be a part of it. 
Anil Jose, co-ordinator of the project, said that the shadow cabinet will be inclusive. It will be headed by a woman, with at least 50% of cabinet berths also reserved for women, and will also have representatives from marginalised communities. He said it would not take corporate funding, as that would dent its credibility, and will be run with funds collected from ordinary people instead. “It will help us fight for people’s cause,” he said.

Finance ministers and officials from three southern states met in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday to discuss the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission. The three states – Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka – and the Union territory of Puducherry strongly opposed the terms of reference for the devolution of funds to states, PTI reported.
Tamil Nadu and Telangana did not participate in the meeting.
The Finance Commission decides the distribution of money collected in taxes by the Centre among the states. The government’s terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission say that it should use the 2011 Census, and not the 1971 Census as has been the norm, as the base year to determine how the tax revenue is divided. The southern states have opposed this.
A state’s population is a significant factor in determining how the tax revenue is distributed, and southern states, which have controlled their population growth over the decades, fear that the new base year will harm their interests.
Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it was “only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union government to reframe the terms of reference”.

Chandrakanth Viswanath | News18 Updated: April 10, 2018, 3:01 PM IST A meeting of finance ministers from southern states being held in Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala on April 10, 2018. Thiruvananthapuram: In a first of its kind exercise, the finance ministers of the southern states met in the city and came down heavily on the central government for its alleged ill-treatment of the said states. Representatives from the three states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh in addition to Kerala and Puducherry got together, while Telangana and Tamil Nadu abstained. Andhra was represented by finance minister Eramala Ramakrishnudu while Karnataka by its agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda and Puducherry by Chief Minister V Narayansamy, who is also the finance minister. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who inaugurated the meet, demanded revision in the terms of reference by the 15th Finance Commission as it questions the fiscal federalism and principles of democratic governance. ""There is a conspicuous bias inbuilt in the terms of reference. That would prevent the Finance Commission to fulfil the constitutional responsibility. Penalising the performing states cannot be justified. There is a blatant interventionism in the fiscal rights of the states. This might end up in changing the Finance Commission from constituent authority to administrative mechanism,"" he said. In a fiery address, Puducherry Chief Minister said there is a grave injustice to the best performing states. “The best performing states are penalised while the worst performing are being rewarded. The PM always says about cooperative federalism but it is actually a dictatorship. The states are suffering as the Centre is taking away the power of the states. Who are you to dictate us? We know the pulse of the people. We are designing the populist schemes by knowing the pulse of the people,”said Narayansamy. ""We have a wonderful governor in Kiran Bedi. She blocks all the files that I give. I am fighting with her every day,"" added Puducherry Chief Minister. Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac and Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala are also attending the meet. South Indian Concerns The 15th Finance Commission, constituted in November 2017, recognises population as an important criterion for distribution of taxes between the Centre and states. It will use data from the 2011 census while making recommendations for the five-year period beginning from 2020. The southern states want the recommendations to be based on 1971 census data. The states say that in comparison to northern states, they have recorded significant progress in population control. Also Watch",english

The Finance Commission — which delves into the financial relations between the Centre and states — should be guided more by its constitutional mandate than arbitrary terms of reference, Vijayan said in his inaugural address at the one-day workshop in Thiruvananthapuram. 
The workshop was called by state Finance Minister Thomas Issac for his counterparts from southern states to express resentment against the Centre and to have a detailed review and critique of the terms of reference of the Finance Commission. 
Finance Minister of Tamil Nadu and Telengana were conspicuous by their absence at the event.

“The reframing of the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country and to reinforce its unity and integrity,” said Vijayan, a senior Communist Party of India-Marxist leader from Kerala. 
Vijayan said the commission role assumes significance, given the fact that the Centre is given near monopoly over the right to mobilise resources. 
“We are all aware that the terms of reference have created apprehension about the principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in devolution of financial powers and resources to the states by the Centre,” the Chief Minister added. 
Vijayan expressed reservation over the Financial Commission proposal for “measurable performance-based-incentives” which he claimed was an attack on the federal structure of the Indian state. 
“Such terms of reference, we fear, might end up altering the commission’s status from a constitutional authority entrusted with devolution of national fiscal resources to an administrative mechanism for fiscal administration and monitoring,” added Vijayan. SHARE",english

Finance ministers of just three southern states and one union territory met on Tuesday in Thiruvananthapuram, at a conference convened by Kerala, to discuss the concerns surrounding the 'Terms of Reference (ToR)'' of the 15th Finance Commission. The meeting, which aimed to host representatives from across southern India, failed to draw the finance ministers of Tamil Nadu and Telangana. 
Representatives of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry, along with Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan were present at the meeting. Finance ministers of the southern states met on Tuesday in Thiruvananthapuram. News18 
Speaking at the event, Andhra Pradesh finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu said that without asking any state governments, the Centre arbitrarily decided the ToR which, according to him, are against the laws of the land. 
""We've to see that more power is given to [the] states. 80 percent of development will be done by states & only 20 percent by the Centre,"" Y Ramakrishnudu was quoted as saying by ANI . 
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also voiced concerns over the ToR, terming them ""seriously flawed"". He said the ToR would adversely affect the better-performing states. 
Expressing his disappointment to reporters on Monday, Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac said the changes in the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission, that would adversely affect the southern states, must become a debate in the country. 
""The objective of the conference was to highlight the issue and make it a national agenda for debate"", Isaac said. Slamming the Centre, he said the ToR was against the federal co-operative structure of the country. ""We will not allow to destroy the federal co-operative structure of the nation', he said. 
Earlier, Chidambaram had said the central government has ""lit a fire"" and it should be doused before the southern ""flames scorch the federation"". Better-governed and better-performing states have already lost crucial fractions in their shares, he had said. 
The former finance and home minister had pointed out that the Finance Commission shall use population data from the 2011 Census and not the 1971 Census that was used hitherto. ""Structurally, the Constitution gives more powers of taxation to the Centre and more responsibilities of expenditure to the states. Hitherto, the population data was taken from the 1971 Census. The ‘freeze' was agreed upon to protect the states that had done well in stabilising their population,"" he said. 
According to The Indian Express , this isn't the first time that states are protesting against the ToR of the Finance Commissions. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik raised similar concerns in 2013, saying the ToR would impact as many as 11 states.

Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 10 (PTI) Three non-BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry today came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states.At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states here, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states.Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions.However, AIADMK ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission.Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the 'conspicuous bias' in-built in the ToR of the new commission.It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said.""Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,"" Vijayan added.Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states.""We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,"" the chief minister said.Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies.""This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states',"" he said.Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition.They were against ToR 'unilaterally' stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions.Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an 'eye opener' for the union government.Best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them.Narayanasamy also came down on the recommendation to do away with Central funds for 'populous schemes' of states.He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, 'but what was actually happening is dictatorship"".""They want to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,"" he added.On GST, he said there was a 30 per cent decline in revenue of the Union Territory after implementation of new tax regime, though it had been repeatedly said GST would be very beneficial to consumer states like Kerala and Puducherry.""We have to revolt against the Union Government for our rights. It is high time that the Government of India changes the ToR and includes Puducherry also in the ToR,"" Narayanasamy said.Representing Karnataka, agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said his state fully supports views of other states.Karnataka was of the opinion that all progressive states, including perhaps all the southern states, have been 'disincentivised' by means of the ToR, he said.State Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac in his opening remarks said it was estimated that Kerala was bound to lose around Rs 80,000 crore due the present ToR.

The conclave of southern finance ministers was inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at Mascot Hotel today Morning.
While inaugurating the meeting, Chief Minister Pinarayi blasted on Union government for undermining federalism to drive political agendas in order to throttle opposition governments.
According to the Chief Minister of Kerala, Modi government has used 15th finance commission politically to"" limit states opportunities to generate their revenue.""
""We appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission.The reframing of the terms of reference is imperative, to strengthen the federal structure of the country on one hand, and to reinforce the unity and integrity of the nation on the other,"" Chief Minister pointed out.
He indicated the huge and worsening gap between the distribution of power to mobilise resources on the one hand, and to spend on development and welfare responsibilities on the other, trapping the government excelled in social development models for the country.
Pinarayi blamed the Modi government is throttling opposition governments and Kerala especially for initiating developmental programmes.
""The States in India today neither have the resources to fulfill their tasks as laid down in the Constitution nor do they have the right to raise such resources. The present situation is not because of the action of the States, but is directly the consequence of the policies pursued by the Union Government, "" chief Minister pointed out.
Chief Minister told India Today that due to excelling in social sectors, Kerala is being penalised by Union government.
""Our major liability is geriatric care and we have to spend huge amount . But finance Commission is penalising us for excelling in social sectors,"" he said.
While making the presidential address, Dr Thomas Issac stated that Kerala would spear head the protest against the anomalies during the 15th finance commission.
""We are at the receiving end as population growth and providing best medical care had trapped us,"" Isaac told India Today.
It was Puducherry Narayana Swami who triggered a debate on BJP government's agenda on the new formation of finance commission.
Chief Minister Narayana Swami shared that he had met NK singh, Chairman of the Commission who told him that he was helpless in changing the norms.
""I spoke to him and pleaded that he should change the norms. But, he told me that only President of India who can change the norms,"" he said .
It's a new war front Kerala is opening with opposition governments in the south, a political war to diffuse BJP.

It eventually waned as even the film fraternity is divided after a group of filmmakers who tread the middle ground chose to frown at the so-called 'superstars'- backed film fraternity.
The more aggressive, 'Tamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Panpaattu Peravai' (Tamil People's Art, Literary, Cultural Federation) floated by the middle ground directors led by P Bharathiraja on Monday has hit the street in a bid to hold up CSK-KKR Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday evening.
The veteran Bharathiraja sees offering resistance to IPL as a 'moral duty.' In this regard the newly floated federation which consists of filmmakers Thangar Bachan, RK Selvamani, Ameer and Vetrimaran and actor Sathyaraj announced they would gather near the Anna Statue today evening. In their first press briefing on Monday angst of director's like Thangar Bachan came to the fore over 'superstars' grabbing the limelight, not to mention about their cinemas.

Will it be a perfect homecoming for CSK after two-year ban?
The path chosen by the new forum is diametrically opposite to the stand taken by actors-turned-politicians Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth.
The silent protest organised under the aegis of South Indian Artists' Association, popularly known as 'Nadigar Sangam,’ on April 8 saw the twosome participate besides Sathyaraj, Ilayaraja and Vijay.
Before heading for the protest venue Rajinikanth told the media that IPL can be held up under current circumstances when the state is fighting for Cauvery water because celebrations would certainly mean embarrassment. However he didn’t take an unyielding stand. He came out with other options saying, if it’s not possible, at least, to reflect people's mood the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) players can wear black badges when they come out to play, if the BCCI, IPL authorities and Chennai team owners cooperate. If not, at least the fans who go to IPL matches can wear black badges, he suggested.
The cricket fans however see no logic behind opposing a sports event over Cauvery issue and their reasoning cannot be belittled.
In the meantime, the opposition DMK and its allies led by MK Stalin are currently undertaking a rally covering the Cauvery delta districts.
The ruling AIADMK seems content playing second–fiddle to the BJP government at the Centre. It chose to keep away from the meeting of finance ministers of southern states at Thiruvananthapuram today wherein the participants reportedly came down heavily on the Centre for its alleged sidelining of southern states. Tamil Nadu and Telengana reportedly boycotted the meet inaugurated by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

It eventually waned as even the film fraternity is divided after a group of filmmakers who tread the middle ground chose to frown at the so-called 'superstars'- backed film fraternity.
The more aggressive, 'Tamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Panpaattu Peravai' (Tamil People's Art, Literary, Cultural Federation) floated by the middle ground directors led by P Bharathiraja on Monday has hit the street in a bid to hold up CSK-KKR Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday evening.
The Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) cadres, filmmakers Bharathiraja, Vetrimaran, lyricist Vairamuthu were among those who have hit the streets to protest against IPL. Owing to ongoing protests, there was a delay in players reaching the ground from the hotel on Tuesday evening. The Anna Salai in Chennai is swamped by anti-IPL protesters owing allegiance to various outfits. Lately, the Seeman-led Naam Tamizhar Katchi cadres blocked Anna Salai. The police are trying to remove the protesters at various points.
Protesters demand Cauvery Water Management Board immediately. May 3 is still a long way away, say agitators. Lyricist Vairamuthu said, ""This is not a permanent struggle against cricket. This isn't a protest against the police as well. Our objective is to protest in a peaceful way. The people of the state should try to understand if some protesters cross the line. We have hit the streets seeking justice. We'll fight till we get a solution for the issue.""
The veteran Bharathiraja sees offering resistance to IPL as a 'moral duty.' In this regard the newly floated federation which consists of filmmakers Thangar Bachan, RK Selvamani, Ameer and Vetrimaran and actor Sathyaraj announced they would gather near the Anna Statue today evening. In their first press briefing on Monday angst of director's like Thangar Bachan came to the fore over 'superstars' grabbing the limelight, not to mention about their cinemas.

The path chosen by the new forum is diametrically opposite to the stand taken by actors-turned-politicians Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth.
The silent protest organised under the aegis of South Indian Artists' Association, popularly known as 'Nadigar Sangam,’ on April 8 saw the twosome participate besides Sathyaraj, Ilayaraja and Vijay.
Before heading for the protest venue Rajinikanth told the media that IPL can be held up under current circumstances when the state is fighting for Cauvery water because celebrations would certainly mean embarrassment. However he didn’t take an unyielding stand. He came out with other options saying, if it’s not possible, at least, to reflect people's mood the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) players can wear black badges when they come out to play, if the BCCI, IPL authorities and Chennai team owners cooperate. If not, at least the fans who go to IPL matches can wear black badges, he suggested.
The cricket fans however see no logic behind opposing a sports event over Cauvery issue and their reasoning cannot be belittled.
In the meantime, the opposition DMK and its allies led by MK Stalin are currently undertaking a rally covering the Cauvery delta districts.
The ruling AIADMK seems content playing second–fiddle to the BJP government at the Centre. It chose to keep away from the meeting of finance ministers of southern states at Thiruvananthapuram today wherein the participants reportedly came down heavily on the Centre for its alleged sidelining of southern states. Tamil Nadu and Telengana reportedly boycotted the meet inaugurated by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry didn’t attend the meeting of south states’ finance ministers on Tuesday. Photo: PTI Bengaluru: Finance ministers of three southern states on Tuesday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government and expressed opposition to the terms of reference issued for the 15th Finance Commission, which they said left them worse off.
Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are worried that the Finance Commission’s proposal to use the 2011 census, instead of the current 1971 census, as the criteria for revenue devolution will disadvantage them as they have implemented population control programmes better than states in the North. States with larger populations get more of the central funds.
The forum hosted by Kerala’s Left Front government in Thiruvananthapuram also became an occasion to come down heavily on the Union government, which, the leaders claimed, was trying to colour the Finance Commission with its ideology and using it to micromanage the fiscal domain of the state government.
Inaugurating the meet, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the terms of reference should be reframed. “This reframing of the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country on the one hand and to reinforce the unity and the integrity of the nation on the other,” he said.
The Commission should not venture to impose the ideological and economic agenda of the union government over the state governments, he said. “It is not the task of a finance commission to create roadmaps for fiscal management or impose its perception of what policies are good for the people of the state —that is for the democratically elected state governments to decide,” he said.
Karnataka finance minister Krisha Byre Gowda argued that the sudden change of population base would disrupt the state economy. Gowda said that southern states are “the growth engines” who are “supporting not only the Union government but also other states” and to disrupt their finances would adversely impact the finances of all states as well as the centre.
“Bringing down the rate of growth of population does not mean less expenditure for states. On the contrary, it creates new commitments by the states to those in the labour force and to senior citizens,” Vijayan said.
The finance ministers also came down heavily on the proposed move to introduce performance-based awards through the Finance Commission. The southern states are far ahead in implementing some of the centrally sponsored schemes, such as open-defecation free or rural electricity connect, and to judge their performance to award revenue shares could end up as arbitrary and unjust, said Andhra finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu.
He also said that a similar meet will be held in his state in future, where he would invite all states to discuss the issues associated with the finance commission. “This affects all states,” he said.
The forum was also attended by Puducherry chief minister V Narayansamy while Tamil Nadu and Telangana stayed away.
Narayansamy, perhaps the forum’s most critical voice against the central government, said the centre discriminates against his state, hitting its coffers by appointing separate finance commissions for union territories, even though they are considered like any other states when it comes to Centre-government sponsored programs. “You considered me as a state when it pleases you, and you don’t when it’s not. You tell me who I am,” he said.
Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, the brain behind the forum, said he does not view it as a political rally yet. “I don’t want to pre-judge the issues but I would want to name them in their order of priorities...it is not a political forum yet but it can turn political if the commission chose not to respond,” he said. “Today is only a beginning.”

(Eds: Adds Kerala Finance Minister's reax) Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 10 (PTI) Three non-BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry today came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states.At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states here, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states.Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions.However, AIADMK ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission.Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR.""We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Orissa, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference, Isaac said.Stating that all states would be affected, he said BJP ruled states were also welcome to the conference.However, he expressed doubt about their participation as ToR was drawn up by the BJP government at the Centre.The memorandum would be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said.On the outcome of today's meet, he said the states, which participated, came together on several issues.They were of the view that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre's share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said.""If this is allowed to succeed, states would become a glorified muncipalities,"" Isaac added.The 15th Finance Commission was expected to visit the state in May, he said to a question.He also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations.Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the 'conspicuous bias' in-built in the ToR of the new commission.It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said.""Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,"" Vijayan added.Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states.""We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,"" the chief minister said.Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies.""This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states',"" he said.Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition.They were against ToR 'unilaterally' stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions.Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an 'eye opener' for the union government.Best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them.Narayanasamy also came down on the recommendation to do away with Central funds for 'populous schemes' of states.He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, 'but what was actually happening is dictatorship"".""They want to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,"" he added.On GST, he said there was a 30 per cent decline in revenue of the Union Territory after implementation of new tax regime, though it had been repeatedly said GST would be very beneficial to consumer states like Kerala and Puducherry.""We have to revolt against the Union Government for our rights. It is high time that the Government of India changes the ToR and includes Puducherry also in the ToR,"" Narayanasamy said.Representing Karnataka, agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said his state fully supports views of other states.Karnataka was of the opinion that all progressive states, including perhaps all the southern states, have been 'disincentivised' by means of the ToR, he said.Isaac in his opening remarks said it was estimated that Kerala was bound to lose around Rs 80,000 crore due the present ToR.

Three non-BJP ruled southern States on April 10 demanded reframing the Terms of Reference of the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to States, saying it was in contradiction to the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution. 
In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Finance Ministers of three south Indian States and the Union Territory of Puducherry that stare at drastic cuts in Central transfers in the wake of the Terms of Reference (ToR) met in Thiruvananthapuram to discuss the challenges ahead, observing it was against the interests of the progressive States. 
At the conclave, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh as well as the Congress-ruled Puducherry while opposing the ToR said it was in contradiction to the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to the performing States. 
Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by the previous Finance Commissions. However, the AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS-ruled Telangana opted out of the conference hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. 
Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the ‘conspicuous bias’ in-built in the ToR of the new commission. It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Centre would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said. “Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,” Mr. Vijayan added. 
Mr. Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the States. “We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,” the CPI(M) veteran said. Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said the ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. “This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of States,” he said. 
Backing the southern States, senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram in a tweet said the ToR was “seriously flawed” and would adversely affect the better-performing states. Earlier, he had said the Centre has “lit a fire” and that it should be doused before the southern “flames scorch the federation”. 
Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition. The State was against ToR “unilaterally” stipulated by the Centre without consulting the States, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions.

He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he talks about cooperative federalism at all meetings, “but what was actually happening is dictatorship”. 
“They want to impose (various things) on States in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the States,” he added.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley rejected the charge of bias against the southern states, asserting there was no inherent bias or mandate in the ToRs which can be construed as discriminatory against the states which made good progress in population control. 

Jaitley also said a ""needless controversy"" is sought to be created that the ToRs are loaded against any particular region of the country. ""Nothing could be further from truth"", he said in a Facebook post. 

In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the finance ministers of southern states that stare at the prospect of drastic cuts in Central transfers in the wake of the ToR met here to discuss the challenges ahead, alleging it was biased against some of the progressive states. 

At the conclave, Kerala , Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh as well as the Congress-ruled union territory of Puducherry while opposing the ToR said it was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to the performing states. 

Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by the previous Finance Commissions. 

AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS-ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. 

Briefing reporters on the deliberations, Kerala Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR. 

""We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Orissa, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference,"" Isaac said. 

On the outcome of the meet, he said the states, which participated, came together on several issues. 

The ministers were of the view that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre's share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said. ""If this is allowed to succeed, states would become a glorified muncipalities"". 

Inaugurating the conclave, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the 'conspicuous bias' in-built in the ToR of the new commission. 

It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said. 

""Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,"" Vijayan added. 

Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states. 

""We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,"" the CPI-M veteran said. 

Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said the ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. 

""This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states',"" he said. 

Backing the southern states, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram in a tweet said the ToR was ""seriously flawed"" and would adversely affect the better-performing states. Earlier, he had said the Centre has ""lit a fire"" and that it should be doused before the southern ""flames scorch the federation"". 

Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the TDP-ruled state was against ToR ""unilaterally"" stipulated by the Centre without consulting the states demanded it be reframed after discussions. 

Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an ""eye opener"" for the union government. 

The best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them. 

He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, 'but what was actually happening is dictatorship"". 

""We have to revolt against the Union Government for our rights"". 

Representing Karnataka, Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said his state fully supports the views of other states. 

Karnataka was of the opinion that all progressive states, including perhaps all the southern states, have been 'disincentivised' by means of the ToR, he said.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has demanded that the Centre reframe the terms of reference (ToR) of the 15th Union Finance Commission (UFC) and accused it of using the commission as a tool to impose its ideological and economic agenda on States. 
Inaugurating a conclave of Finance Ministers of Southern States held here on Tuesday to discuss the ToR of the commission, Mr. Vijayan said that reframing of the ToR was imperative for strengthening the federal structure and reinforcing the unity and integrity of the nation. 
The commission’s role assumed special significance given the fact that the Centre had near-monopoly over the right to mobilise resources. This bias in the distribution of fiscal powers was more glaring ever since the introduction of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) which had led to further erosion of fiscal autonomy of the States. The commission’s foremost objective was an equitable distribution of financial resources. The commission’s recommendations assumed further significance as the finances of States had received a double blow in the form of demonetisation and the GST. The freedom of the States to raise resources had been restricted by the introduction of the GST and it was further restricted by the equal division of taxes despite the recommendations of the Chief Economic Adviser that States be allocated a higher share. 
The GST had taken away the right of the States to design their own special initiatives in resource mobilisation. They now have hardly any major tax left with them to make a difference to State resources. 
Therefore, the vertical devolution should not be brought down from the 42% awarded by the 14th commission, he said. 
The blatant interventionism of the Centre finds dangerous expression in the statement that “the commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all,” he said. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac presided. 
Chief Minister of Puducherry V. Narayanasamy, Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamal Rama Krishundu and Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda attended the meeting. Finance Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Telangana did not turn up for the conclave.",english

(Eds: Adds Kerala Finance Minister's reax) Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 10 (PTI) Three non-BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry today came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states.At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states here, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and will also result in revenue loss for performing states.Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions.However, AIADMK ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission.Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR.""We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Orissa, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference,"" Isaac said.Stating that all states will be affected, he said BJP ruled states were also welcome to the conference.However, he expressed doubt about their participation as ToR was drawn up by the BJP government at the Centre.The memorandum will be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said.On the outcome of today's meet, he said the states, which participated, came together on several issues.They were of the view that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre's share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said.""If this is allowed to succeed, states would become a glorified municipalities,"" Isaac added.The 15th Finance Commission was expected to visit the state in May, he said to a question.He also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations.Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the 'conspicuous bias' in-built in the ToR of the new commission.It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government will prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said.""Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,"" Vijayan added.He said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states.""We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,"" the chief minister added.Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies.""This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states',"" he said.Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition.They were against ToR 'unilaterally' stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions.Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an 'eye opener' for the Union Government.Best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them.Narayanasamy also came down on the recommendation to do away with Central funds for 'populous schemes' of states.He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, 'but what was actually happening is dictatorship"".""They want to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,"" Narayanasamy added.On GST, he said there was a 30 per cent decline in revenue of the Union Territory after implementation of new tax regime, though it had been repeatedly said GST would be very beneficial to consumer states like Kerala and Puducherry.""We have to revolt against the Union Government for our rights.

We have decided to prepare a joint memorandum on the manner in which the Finance Commission should go about things and take different states into confidence, Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac told the media here. The states would even explore legal steps on the issue, Issac said at the end of a workshop he organised here for his counterparts from southern states to facilitate a review and critique of the terms of reference. We have entrusted (state-owned) Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation to prepare a draft and by end of April or early May, we will meet again to finalise the memorandum in Visakhapatnam. We will also invite governments of other non-BJP ruled states. Thereafter, the memorandum will be send to the President and others, Issac said. Earlier, in his inaugural address at the one-day event, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it's time they stood together to demand reframing of the terms of reference), as it was necessary to save the federal structure of the Indian Union. The Finance Commission -- which delves into the financial relations between the Centre and states -- should be guided more by its constitutional mandate than arbitrary terms of reference, Vijayan said. ... (there is) a conspicuous bias in-built in the terms of reference of the new commission. It is widely feared that these terms framed by the Centre will prevent the panel from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, Vijayan added. Apart from Vijayan and Issac, those who attended the workshop were Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Rama Krishnudu and other top officials. Representatives from Telengana and Tamil Nadu were absent. Vijayan said all states should appeal to the central government to reframe the terms of reference. The reframing of the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country and to reinforce its unity and integrity, said Vijayan, a senior Communist Party of India-Marxist leader from Kerala. Vijayan said the commission's role assumes significance, given the fact that the Centre is given near monopoly over the right to mobilise resources. We are all aware that the terms of reference have created apprehension about the principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in devolution of financial powers and resources to the states by the Centre, the Chief Minister added. Vijayan expressed reservation over the Financial Commission proposal for measurable performance-based-incentives which he claimed was an attack on the federal structure of the Indian state. Such terms of reference, we fear, might end up altering the commission's status from a constitutional authority entrusted with devolution of national fiscal resources to an administrative mechanism for fiscal administration and monitoring, added Vijayan. Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, in his address, said all states that performed their duty of bringing down the population in their respective jurisdictions, were set to lose out since the plan is to shift the base from 1971 to 2011 Census. Ramakrishnudu flayed the Centre for alleged arbitrary manner in fixing the commission's terms of reference. Puducherry's Narayanasamy, who also holds the finance portfolio, complained that when it came to central schemes, the Union government treated Puducherry as a state but with regard to grants it was treated as a union territory. --IANS",english

The conclave was attended by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Puducherry. The states criticized the TOR which they said punished progressive states 
Finance ministers of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh met at 'Conclave of South Indian Finance Ministers' to discuss and raise concerns on the Terms of Reference (TOR) in the 15th Finance Commission. 
The conclave was hosted by Kerala with CM Pinarayi Vijayan in attendance. There was no representation from Tamil Nadu and Telangana. 
The meeting decided to convene a larger conclave within a fortnight. Representatives of West Bengal, Punjab, Odisha and New Delhi will be invited for the next conclave which will be held in Vishakhapattanam. 
Finance minister of Kerala Dr TM Thomas Issac said that southern states have reached a consensus on the issues affecting them in the TOR of the 15th finance commission. 
""TOR is trying to impose interests of central government on states. This certainly is unconstitutional. Today's meeting discussed various factors including the use of 2011 census as the base point for revenue allocation. State governments will have great difficulty if they are forced to cut down their popular programmes. Certainly, it's impossible for all states to reach a consensus, but there are some areas that will affect the progressive southern states,"" said Issac. 
He also took a dig at Tamil Nadu for not sending a representative. 
""We are fighting for the interest of Tamil Nadu as well. Deputy CM O Pannerselvam had initially agreed to attend the conference but backed out later on,"" said the finance minister of Kerala. 
Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy alleged that the central government is ignoring the union territory. 
""Puducherry is not even included in the Finance Commission. The centre considers Puducherry as a state when it wants to collect taxes but treats us as union territories when fund allocation is concerned,"" he said. 
Karnataka said that the current TOR punishes the progressive states and rewards the under-performers. 
Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramarkrishnudu pointed out that after the bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh has become a state with financial deficit and the new terms of reference (TOR) may worsen the situation for the state.",english

The meeting in Thiruvanthapuram on Tuesday was attended by Puducherry chief minister V Narayanaswamy who also holds the finance portfolio, Andhra Pradesh finance minister Y Ramakrishnadu, Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda and Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac. 
Interestingly , the finance ministers of Tamil Nadu and Telengana skipped the event. Puducherry and Karnataka are ruled by Congress governments and Andhra by the Telugu Desam Party, which recently exited the NDA. 
The finance ministers told the media after the meeting that changes in the terms of reference (ToR) of the finance commission would adversely affect the southern states and said they will form a bloc to carry forward their fight. They said they shouldn’t be penalised for successfully implementing policies of the union government. 
The ToR recommended that the 2011 census be used as the benchmark for allocating funds to the states compared to the 1971 census which was being used earlier. The share of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka in the country’s population declined from 22% in 1971 to 18.2% in 2011 . The ToR also reduced the weightage for fiscal discipline. 
The southern states claim that these skew allocation of central funds is in favour of states with large populations like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 
The recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission come into effect from April 1, 2020. 
In a late evening statement on Wednesday, finance minister Arun Jaitley termed the controversy over the finance commission’s recommendations “needless”. 
He added that the commission’s recommendations are based on an assessment of the needs of the states (based on population) and “Income Distance” (a measure of relative poverty) and that, as a result, more resources go to poorer states “which need additional funds for providing education, health, and other services to the people” which these states might otherwise not be able to provide. 
Puducherry chief minister Narayanaswamy, who also holds the finance portfolio, said the union government’s policies were forcing some of the states to revolt against it. “The Centre is usurping the rights of states and dictating terms.” 
Kerala state finance minister Thomas Issac, who organised the meeting, claimed his state stood to lose at least ~20,000 crore if the new terms of reference are used. Tamil Nadu would lose twice that, he added. Together, the four southern states and Puducherry would lose ~80,000 crore. 
It isn’t just about the South and the North, Issac clarified. More states such as Delhi, Punjab, and Odisha would be invited to join the bloc, he said, listing three more states with non-BJP or non-NDA governments. 
Andhra Pradesh finance minister Ramakrishandu said most of the policies of the Union government were arbitrary in nature and against the federal polity of the country. “We need more power. At least 80% of the developmental activities are carried out by states and the Centre is only doing 20%,” he said. 
His view was echoed by Karnataka agriculture minister Gowda who said that instead of lauding the southern states for executing national policies (such as those on population control) effectively, the union government seems keen to penalise them. 
Tamil Nadu and Telengana did not send any representatives to the meeting. TN Deputy CM O Paneerselvam, who also holds the finance portfolio, skipped the meeting. The state’s decision not to send a senior minister is being viewed as a move aimed at keeping the Centre happy. 
Telangana’s chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had turned down the invitation , saying such meetings were against the spirit of national integration. “Some states are talking about the north-south divide. This is not good for national integration. The Centre should take necessary actions to avert such situations,” he had said. Like Tamil Nadu, Telangana’s decision to skip the meeting is being viewed as a part of its political strategy. 
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who inaugurated the meeting, said the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission have created enough apprehensions about the principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development. 
“The finance commission’s proposal is nothing short of an attack on the federal structure mandated by the constitution. Reframing the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country and to reinforce its unity and integrity” he added. 
In his statement, though, Jaitley pointed out that the 14th finance commission, which increased the share of states’ revenue to 42% from 32%, had already set a precedent by giving 10% weightage to the 2011 census data. He added that the ToR of the 15th commission includes a provision for rewarding with special incentives states that have done well in terms of population control. “There is no inherent bias or mandate in the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission which can be construed as discriminatory against the states which made good progress in population control,” he said.

(Photo: DC) Chennai: The arterial Anna Salai turned into battlefield as the members of Tamil outfits and some movie personalities turned their robust Cauvery demonstrations into anti-IPL outburst on Tuesday, paralysing traffic and throwing normal life out of gear for several hours post-lunch.
The protesters want the IPL matches to be shifted to outside TN or at least postponed until the Cauvery issue is resolved to benefit the state farmers, arguing that this would bring international attention to their woes and force the Centre to constitute the Cauvery Management Board.
Police had a tough time controlling the crowd and a TV grab had one of them on his knees being repeatedly punched by a protester with several of his comrades in black shirts helping him. Film director Bharatiraja, lyricist Vairamuthu, Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) leader Seeman, were among the many celebrities taken into custody after they refused to disperse with their supporters.
The IPL match between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders started on time at 8 pm, though the two umpires got slightly delayed reaching the MAC Stadium at Chepauk from the hotel in curtained vans with heavy police escort.
The game halted briefly some 30 minutes later as five NTK members raised slogans and hurled chappals into the ground. They were taken away by the police and detained. They had sneaked into the stadium with tickets, dressed in red T-shirts and wearing CSK headbands.
The stadium had become virtually a fortress with about 4000 policemen, including commandos and the Rapid Action Force, deployed for the IPL tie, the first since 2015.
“Most of the fans managed to get into the stadium, though a few got delayed due to the protests en route. Of course, some of them with tickets could have chosen the safe comfort of home TVs rather than risk wading through the angry Cauvery crowd”, said a senior police officer captaining a segment of the beleaguered force at Chepauk. “Our big challenge would be to ensure that these fans got back home safely”, he said, sounding worried.
IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla reiterated that the Chennai matches would go on as per schedule — 10 April to 20 May — and it was up to the police to ensure security to the players and spectators. He had met the Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba earlier in the day to plead for Central intervention to ensure that the Cauvery protesters do not derail the IPL matches. ""The home secretary spoke to Tamil Nadu DGP and asked him to ensure that there were no security issues for the fans"", Congress leader and senior BCCI official Shukla told PTI.
But then, the robust Cauvery protesters are just as determined to disrupt cricket at Chepauk. ""We will not allow the IPL matches to go on when our Mother Cauvery is thirsty"", said Bharatiraja, while his Kollywood colleague Ameer warned: ""If need be, we will even take up arms such as crowbars and . Even human intelligence is a weapon"".
VCK spokesperson Vanni Arasu was more acerbic in his attack, declaring that if the Tamils continued to be slighted and their rights denied, ""this agitation will intensify and the youth could take up arms"". He slammed the TN CM for ignoring the Cauvery sentiments and permitting the IPL whereas his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan ordered the government buses off roads when the opposition parties called for bandh to protest against the recent SC/ST order of the Supreme Court.
While Vanni Arasu backed the Cauvery protesters who disrupted the IPL match by throwing chappals into the ground, former state minister Gokula Indira said the irresponsible act would show TN in poor light.",english

TRIVANDRUM: The southern states, barring Tamil Nadu and Telangana, have pledged to work in close coordination against federal proposals”penalising” them for achievements in social development.India’s Finance Commission that defines the financial relations between the Centre and states had recently released its terms of reference based on the 2011 Census instead of 1971 that it used to be for sharing funds.It also wants to link all welfare schemes to the federal government’s flagship programmes in vital areas like poverty alleviation and universal education and healthcare instead of states coming out with populist plans.The relatively progressive southern states feel they were being denied their due share for their remarkable achievements in these areas as well as birth control and fiscal prudence.While Kerala’s decadal population growth rate is 9.4 per cent and the southern states’ average 13.3, it is 28.6 in Bihar, 28.4 in Rajasthan, 25.9 in Uttar Pradesh and 24.3 in Madhya Pradesh and they stand to gain “demographic dividends”.They say this is unconstitutional after obtaining “near monopoly” over the states’ right to mobilise resources through the Goods and Service Tax (GST) introduced last year and the proposals would further undermine their fiscal autonomy.Congress party-ruled Karnataka and Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh ruled by the Telugu Desam Party, which recently left Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s coalition, attended a conclave of the southern states held here on Tuesday on this. Karnataka’s agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the commission should strike a balance between equity and efficiency and refrain from penalising progress made by individual states.“We are not against any region or the Centre. In fact, strong Centre and states would make the entire country stronger,” he said.“We want a strong Centre, and we are ready to cooperate. But we should work towards a win-win equation instead of creating winners and losers.” He criticised the Modi administration for restricting states from launching welfare schemes on their own which had helped them in the past to improve universal healthcare, poverty alleviation and school enrolments.He said the southern states were pioneers in many schemes showing the Centre the way and the midday meal scheme Karnataka introduced in 2001, which many dubbed as populist, got replicated nationally.“All the progressive states should be incentivised for the progress they make in these areas rather than restraining their constitutional rights,” he said.“Now a double whammy (the centralised taxation and reduced devolution of resources) is being dealt on the states.” He said his state had already made remarkable achievements in rural road connectivity and electrification, which again would become a reason for not allocating funds for newer areas.“The states in India today neither have the resources to fulfil their tasks as laid down in the Constitution nor do they have the right to raise such resources,” Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who inaugurated the conclave said. “There is thus a great asymmetry in India’s federal system. The Centre’s capacity to mobilise resources is far greater than that of the states, but they are required to undertake development expenditures that exceed their revenue generating capabilities.”",english

The Finance Commission -- which delves into the financial relations between the Centre and states -- should be guided more by its constitutional mandate than arbitrary terms of reference, Vijayan said in his inaugural address at the one-day workshop here. The workshop was called by state Finance Minister Thomas Issac for his counterparts from southern states to express resentment against the Centre and to have a detailed review and critique of the terms of reference of the Finance Commission. Finance Minister of Tamil Nadu and Telengana were conspicuous by their absence at the event. ""... (there is) a conspicuous bias in-built in the terms of reference of the new commission. It is widely feared that these terms framed by the Centre will prevent the panel from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility,"" Vijayan added. The Chief Minister said all states should appeal to the central government to reframe the terms of reference. ""The reframing of the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country and to reinforce its unity and integrity,"" said Vijayan, a senior Communist Party of India-Marxist leader from Kerala. Vijayan said the commission role assumes significance, given the fact that the Centre is given near monopoly over the right to mobilise resources. ""We are all aware that the terms of reference have created apprehension about the principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in devolution of financial powers and resources to the states by the Centre,"" the Chief Minister added. Vijayan expressed reservation over the Financial Commission proposal for ""measurable performance-based-incentives"" which he claimed was an attack on the federal structure of the Indian state. ""Such terms of reference, we fear, might end up altering the commission's status from a constitutional authority entrusted with devolution of national fiscal resources to an administrative mechanism for fiscal administration and monitoring,"" added Vijayan. -- IANS (12 hours ago)",english

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurates the conclave of financial ministers of South Indian states in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda, Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and finance minister T.M. Thomas Isaac look on. (Photo: Peethambaran Payyeri ) THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ministers at the first Conclave of Finance Ministers of Southern States agreed to vehemently disagree with the Centre, but only in a handful of issues. As for a number of other terms, for instance the need to universalise direct benefit transfer or even the importance of a revenue deficit grant, a consensus remained elusive. There was resounding consensus to object to the adoption of 2011 census population data as the basis for the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations or the introduction of performance-based incentives for states. All participants condemned the use of 2011 census as discriminatory towards high-performing states. All had criticised the incentive system as ""arbitrary"". They also said in chorus that the powers of the 15th FC were dangerously curtailed by a Centre too keen to encroach on the fiscal space of states. But equally sharp were the differences. The necessity of direct benefit transfer, which the Centre was insisting on, was one. Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanaswamy ridiculed the DBT system. ""It is a process where a granddaughter takes her grandmother to the bank and end up pocketing the money meant for the grandmother. We want to give free rice to the homes of the poor,"" Mr Narayanaswamy said. Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda said that his government was all for DBT. Kerala did not take a definite stand on the issue, though the CPM is ideologically opposed to DBT. Mr Gowda was all for promoting digital economy but the Kerala team was uncomfortable with the idea. Mr Gowda was forthright when he said that perhaps there would not be consensus on all aspects. ""Each state has its own grievances, which may be agreed to by all other states,"" he said. He also emphasised the importance of a minimum programme to achieve a larger unity. ""The idea is also to engage with other states. And in order to bring more states into this, we would have to limit ourselves to those terms that will affect majority of states,"" he said. Again, Karnataka, which is a revenue surplus state, was not enthusiastic about revenue deficit grants, which Kerala and Andhra Pradesh are too eager for. Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry have issues that were originally not part of the framework of the opposition that was sought to be forged. Andhra Pradesh, a large state, wants 'special category status' that is normally accorded to under-performing and north-eastern states. ""The Centre has changed the sharing pattern from 90:10 (90 percent of the cost of a centrally sponsored scheme was borne by the centre) to 60: 40. This has put a 30 percent additional burden on the states,"" Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said. ""This anomaly was identified during 14th FC and since then we have been fighting with centre for special category status,"" he added. In the case of Puducherry, it is not even part of the 15th FC ToR. ""Like Delhi, we are not treated either like a state or a union territory. Neither man nor woman. We are made to feel like a transgender,"" is how Mr Narayanaswamy put it. ""I am here to fight for a space in the 15th FC ToR,"" he said.",english

While distributing the relief fund to the families of 92 missing fishermen at Vettucaud here on Tuesday, Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government had overlooked technicalities while ensuring aid for Ockhi affected families.
“We abandoned conventional routes. If we had followed existing rules, we would not have been able to help these families in a timely manner. There is no word that could comfort them and nothing would substitute the lives that were lost. But those were lives which once protected families, took care of their dear ones and the government had to act swiftly to take care of their family members,” said Pinarayi Vijayan.
An amount of Rs 20 lakh each was distributed to dependants of 92 persons who went missing during Ockhi disaster. Deposit documents were handed over to family members of 92 missing fishermen. Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government would soon purchase three marine ambulances to assist rescue operations in future. “This will be purchased at a cost of Rs 18.24 crore of which BPCL and Cochin Shipyard have agreed to contribute partially from their corporate social responsibility funds.
Minister for tourism and devaswom Kadakampally Surendran said that the state government has gone beyond all false allegations of delay and lapses and has reached out to the Ockhi victims like no other government could. “Even the central government agencies failed in giving proper warning ahead of Ockhi. The state government took lot of blame for that, but all those were false allegations propagated by certain opportunists who were keen on taking advantage of the adversity. A section of media had also tried to hide facts and portray the government in bad light,” said Kadakampally Surendran.
Surendran said that the government acted in such a way that none of the beneficiaries had to wait in government offices to avail the aid. “The government literally took the help to their homes. Around 2,140 Christmas kits were distributed. Families of missing persons were given Rs 10,000 per month without fail,” said Kadakampally Surendran.",english

Narayanaswamy and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan during a conclave of finance ministers of South Indian states in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. (Photo: Peethambaran Payyeri) THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Conclave of Finance Ministers of Southern States, which had its first meeting here on Tuesday, has decided to expand its scope and include more states, including those from north India like West Bengal and Punjab, that could be potentially hurt by the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission. The next round of what would be now called just the ‘Conclave of State Finance Ministers’ will be held in Visakhapatnam, the industrial centre of Andhra Pradesh, by the end of April or early May. Political compulsions forced Tamil Nadu and Telangana to give the Conclave a pass. Only three states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala) and on union territory (Puducherry) participated.
“A joint memorandum would be drawn up after the Visakhapatnam Conclave, where we have decided to rope in at least New Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal and Orissa,” finance minister T.M. Thomas said. “Feelers will be sent to Tamil Nadu and Telangana again,” he added. The tentative understanding is that the memorandum, which will be presented to the President himself, would demand either the amendment of the terms of reference or include addenda to the ToR incorporating the suggestions of the states.
Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) will function as the ‘conclave secretariat’ where the memorandum will be drawn up with inputs from experts in the field. Dr Isaac said that there was consensus at the Conclave that the Centre was purposefully trying to deprive the state of their fair share of the tax collection. “The 14th FC had increased the share of states from the divisible pool to 42 percent. But this they took away through a reduction in grants and a lowering of the Centre’s share in centrally sponsored schemes,” Dr Isaac said.
He said that it was now argued that the Centre required more than the states because it was saddled with more burden in the post-GST scenario. “It is said the Centre has to pay GST compensation to the states. But this is a bogus argument because the compensation is paid from a cess created expressly for the purpose,” the minister said.
The other issue flagged at the Conclave was the stringent conditions being imposed on states. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) guidelines insist that the state should bring down their debt to 20 percent of the GSDP. “Kerala’s debt is now 30 percent, and to bring it down to 20 percent means that we have to shorten our borrowing from three percent of the GSDP to just 1.7 percent of the GSDP. This will be fiscally disastrous,” Isaac said. The participants also strongly opposed the performance incentive mooted in the ToR of the 15th FC. “It is not for a FC to sit in judgement of a state’ performance. If so, the Centre’s performance, too, should be evaluated,” Dr Isaac said.
Karnataka’s agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda was perhaps the most strident critic of the incentive method. “Majority of incentives are designed in a way it affects progressive states negatively.

Narayanasami and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the the conclave. (Photo: Peethambaran Payyeri) THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The very basis of the opposition to the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission is the gargantuan loss of Rs 80,000 crore that all the five south India states put together will supposedly suffer over a period five years. This loss figure but was not arrived at officially by any of the states but has been pulled out of an article by V Bhaskar, which appeared in the March 10 issue of the Economic and Political Weekly. Mr Bhaskar, a former revenue secretary, was a member of the seventh Finance Commission.
This was revealed by finance minister Dr Thomas Isaac himself. “There are various estimates about the losses. But we have mostly used V Bhaskar’s figures that had appeared in the EPW magazine. It is his figure that we have been using for the sake of consistency. In the article he uses 14th FC rewards and the 2011 population growth figures to extrapolate the losses,” Dr Isaac said.
Though Isaac was equally critical of the 14th FC, he conceded that the Commission had transferred more to Kerala. “It happened mainly because forest cover was taken as a major factor while deciding the devolution. After the small northeastern states, we have the largest forest cover, 26 percent. This was a big gain for us,” he said. “Also, the 14th FC for the first time in 30 years conceded that we have revenue deficit, and so they gave us a grant, which during the penultimate fiscal of the UDF tenure was a whopping Rs 4000 crore. If all of this is taken together, we have gained by the 14th FC reward,” he added.",english

Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda, Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and finance minister T.M. Thomas Isaac look on. (Photo: Peethambaran Payyeri ) THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ministers at the first Conclave of Finance Ministers of Southern States agreed to vehemently disagree with the Centre, but only in a handful of issues. As for a number of other terms, for instance the need to universalise direct benefit transfer or even the importance of a revenue deficit grant, a consensus remained elusive. There was resounding consensus to object to the adoption of 2011 census population data as the basis for the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations or the introduction of performance-based incentives for states. All participants condemned the use of 2011 census as discriminatory towards high-performing states.
All had criticised the incentive system as ""arbitrary"". They also said in chorus that the powers of the 15th FC were dangerously curtailed by a Centre too keen to encroach on the fiscal space of states. But equally sharp were the differences. The necessity of direct benefit transfer, which the Centre was insisting on, was one. Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanaswamy ridiculed the DBT system. ""It is a process where a granddaughter takes her grandmother to the bank and end up pocketing the money meant for the grandmother. We want to give free rice to the homes of the poor,"" Mr Narayanaswamy said. Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda said that his government was all for DBT. Kerala did not take a definite stand on the issue, though the CPM is ideologically opposed to DBT.
Mr Gowda was all for promoting digital economy but the Kerala team was uncomfortable with the idea. Mr Gowda was forthright when he said that perhaps there would not be consensus on all aspects. ""Each state has its own grievances, which may be agreed to by all other states,"" he said. He also emphasised the importance of a minimum programme to achieve a larger unity. ""The idea is also to engage with other states. And in order to bring more states into this, we would have to limit ourselves to those terms that will affect majority of states,"" he said.
Again, Karnataka, which is a revenue surplus state, was not enthusiastic about revenue deficit grants, which Kerala and Andhra Pradesh are too eager for. Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry have issues that were originally not part of the framework of the opposition that was sought to be forged. Andhra Pradesh, a large state, wants 'special category status' that is normally accorded to under-performing and north-eastern states. ""The Centre has changed the sharing pattern from 90:10 (90 percent of the cost of a centrally sponsored scheme was borne by the centre) to 60: 40. This has put a 30 percent additional burden on the states,"" Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said.
""This anomaly was identified during 14th FC and since then we have been fighting with centre for special category status,"" he added. In the case of Puducherry, it is not even part of the 15th FC ToR. ""Like Delhi, we are not treated either like a state or a union territory. Neither man nor woman. We are made to feel like a transgender,"" is how Mr Narayanaswamy put it. ""I am here to fight for a space in the 15th FC ToR,"" he said.",english

Three non-BJP-ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry on Tuesday came out against the terms of reference (ToR) stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave of Finance Ministers of southern states here, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR were in contradiction to the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states. Among other things, they also opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions. However, AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS-ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala Finance Minister TM Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April-end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR. The memorandum would be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said. On the outcome of Tuesday’s meet, he said the states, which participated, came together on several issues. They were of the view that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre’s share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said. “If this is allowed to succeed, states would become a glorified muncipalities,” Isaac added. The 15th Finance Commission was expected to visit the state in May, he said to a question. He also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations. Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the ‘conspicuous bias’ in-built in the ToR of the new commission. It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said. “Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,” Vijayan added. Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states. — PTI",english

Speaking after laying the foundation stone for the project at Ernakulam town hall, the chief minister said that such centralized waste treatment plants are required to address the waste menace in big cities, including Kochi.
“Mounting garbage and its effective disposal have always been a perennial problem in bigger cities including Kochi. To solve the issue, we needed a centralized waste treatment plant and decided to construct one at Brahmapuram. Government is also planning to construct waste-to-energy treatment plants at 8 more cities. We are taking all the adequate steps to ensure that proper waste disposal mechanisms are being placed everywhere to tackle issues in this regard,” he said.
In the first phase, a plant to process the garbage and to produce refuse derived fuel (RDF) would be set up at Brahmapuram. In the second phase, the gasification plant to generate energy from RDF will be constructed. It is estimated that around 10 MW of electricity can be generated from the 300 – 400 tonne waste processed at the Brahmapuram plant.
Chief Minister said that government will buy electricity generated at the Brahmapuram plant on a fixed price.
The construction of the Rs 295 crore treatment plant in Brahmapuram had been lying in limbo since 2015 due to issues surrounding the land where the plant was to be build. Two months back, Kochi corporation had handed over 20 acres in Brahmapuram to GJ Eco Power Private Limited for starting the construction of the plant.
Chief minister also stressed on the need to preserve and protect our environment. “The practice of dumping waste materials and garbage in public places and water bodies should be stopped. We should hand over an earth which is filled with pure air and water to our future generations. The waste menace is one of the major factors that trigger the outbreak of various diseases and health issues. There should be a collective effort to stop this practice,” the chief minister said.
Chief minister also said that the construction of the plant at Brahmapuram is carried out in such a way that no damage to environment takes place during the whole process.
K T Jaleel , minister for local administration said that Palakkad, Malappuram and Pandalam municipalities have expressed their willingness to set up waste-to-energy plants in their places.
Meanwhile, members of Kadambrayar Samrakshana Samithy ( Action Council for Kadambrayar Protection ) said that the treatment plant at Brahmapuram is not financially as well as environmentally viable.",english

A protester argues with the police during the flash strike by fringe elements in Chennai on Tuesday demanding scrapping of the IPL matches. (Photo: DC) 
Chennai: The arterial Anna Salai turned into battlefield as the members of Tamil outfits and some movie personalities turned their robust Cauvery demonstrations into anti-IPL outburst on Tuesday, paralysing traffic and throwing normal life out of gear for several hours post-lunch. 
The protesters want the IPL matches to be shifted to outside TN or at least postponed until the Cauvery issue is resolved to benefit the state farmers, arguing that this would bring international attention to their woes and force the Centre to constitute the Cauvery Management Board. 
Police had a tough time controlling the crowd and a TV grab had one of them on his knees being repeatedly punched by a protester with several of his comrades in black shirts helping him. Film director Bharatiraja, lyricist Vairamuthu, Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) leader Seeman, were among the many celebrities taken into custody after they refused to disperse with their supporters. 
The IPL match between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders started on time at 8 pm, though the two umpires got slightly delayed reaching the MAC Stadium at Chepauk from the hotel in curtained vans with heavy police escort. 
The game halted briefly some 30 minutes later as five NTK members raised slogans and hurled chappals into the ground. They were taken away by the police and detained. They had sneaked into the stadium with tickets, dressed in red T-shirts and wearing CSK headbands. 
The stadium had become virtually a fortress with about 4000 policemen, including commandos and the Rapid Action Force, deployed for the IPL tie, the first since 2015. 
“Most of the fans managed to get into the stadium, though a few got delayed due to the protests en route. Of course, some of them with tickets could have chosen the safe comfort of home TVs rather than risk wading through the angry Cauvery crowd”, said a senior police officer captaining a segment of the beleaguered force at Chepauk. “Our big challenge would be to ensure that these fans got back home safely”, he said, sounding worried. 
IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla reiterated that the Chennai matches would go on as per schedule — 10 April to 20 May — and it was up to the police to ensure security to the players and spectators. He had met the Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba earlier in the day to plead for Central intervention to ensure that the Cauvery protesters do not derail the IPL matches. ""The home secretary spoke to Tamil Nadu DGP and asked him to ensure that there were no security issues for the fans"", Congress leader and senior BCCI official Shukla told PTI. 
But then, the robust Cauvery protesters are just as determined to disrupt cricket at Chepauk. ""We will not allow the IPL matches to go on when our Mother Cauvery is thirsty"", said Bharatiraja, while his Kollywood colleague Ameer warned: ""If need be, we will even take up arms such as crowbars and . Even human intelligence is a weapon"". 
VCK spokesperson Vanni Arasu was more acerbic in his attack, declaring that if the Tamils continued to be slighted and their rights denied, ""this agitation will intensify and the youth could take up arms"". He slammed the TN CM for ignoring the Cauvery sentiments and permitting the IPL whereas his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan ordered the government buses off roads when the opposition parties called for bandh to protest against the recent SC/ST order of the Supreme Court. 
While Vanni Arasu backed the Cauvery protesters who disrupted the IPL match by throwing chappals into the ground, former state minister Gokula Indira said the irresponsible act would show TN in poor light.",english

By: FE Bureau | Thiruvananthapuram | Published: April 11, 2018 5:09 AM Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy. (PTI) 
Protesting a “conspicuous bias” which they believe has been built into the terms of reference (ToR) of the 15th Finance Commission (FFC), four southern states on Tuesday demanded that the ToR be reframed in keeping with the constitutional principle of federalism. The FFC’s award will be valid for the 2020-25 period. 
The latest Finance Commission has been asked to pay heed to the “continuing imperative of the national development programme including New India -2022” and the impact of the previous commission’s (liberal) award to states on the Centre’s finances (The 14th Commission had hiked the tax devolution to states to 42% of the divisible pool, up from 32% previously). While this is being interpreted by these states as a signal to the FFC to trim the devolution, what frets them the most is the fact that the commission will use the population data of 2011, instead of 1971, to compute the inter se shares of states from the central tax kitty. 
Also, these states are opposed to inclusion of the Centre’s policies and programmes, including its flagship schemes, direct benefit transfers, digital economy, ease of doing business, sanitation etc among the performance-based incentives for states and consider the commission’s mandate to have a critical look at the state governments’ “populist measures” as an infringement upon their autonomous political space. 
Inaugurating a conference of finance ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Centre would prevent the commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. He said the ToR was unprecedented in asking the commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. “This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states,” he said. Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the state — whose strident demand for special category status has been turned down by the Narendra Modi government, forcing the ruling TDP to walk out of the National Democratic Alliance — said the state was against ToR ‘unilaterally’ stipulated by the Centre without consulting states and called for discussions to re-frame it. 
Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an ‘eye opener’ for the Union government. He came down heavily on the ToR and the commission being tasked with defining “populist schemes” run by the states. “They (the Centre) wants to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,” he added. Among the southern states, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh also have to worry about a potential removal of revenue-deficit grants by the commission, as these are among eleven states currently having this facility. 
Representing Karnataka, agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda said his state fully supported views of the other southern states. Karnataka was of the opinion that all progressive states, including perhaps all the southern states, have been ‘disincentivised’ by means of the ToR, he said. 
Tamil Nadu and Telangana governments were not represented in the conference.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Three non-BJP ruled southern states today demanded reframing the Terms of Reference of the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states, saying it was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution. 
In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the finance ministers of south Indian states that stare at drastic cuts in Central transfers in the wake of the Terms of Reference(ToR) met here to discuss the challenges ahead, observing it was against the interests of the progressive states. 
At the conclave, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh as well as the Congress-ruled union territory of Puducherry while opposing the ToR said it was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to the performing states. 
Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by the previous Finance Commissions. 
However, AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS-ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. 
Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the 'conspicuous bias' in-built in the ToR of the new commission. 
It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said. 
""Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,"" Vijayan added. 
Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states. 
""We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,"" the CPI-M veteran said. 
Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said the ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. 
""This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the fiscal domain of states',"" he said. 
Backing the southern states, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram in a tweet said the ToR was ""seriously flawed"" and would adversely affect the better-performing states. 
Earlier, he had said the Centre has ""lit a fire"" and that it should be doused before the southern ""flames scorch the federation"". 
Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition. 
The state was against ToR ""unilaterally"" stipulated by the Centre without consulting the states, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions. 
Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an ""eye opener"" for the union government. 
The best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them. 
He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, 'but what was actually happening is dictatorship"". 
""They want to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,"" he added. 
On GST, he said there was a 30 per cent decline in revenue of the Union Territory after implementation of new tax regime, though it had been repeatedly said GST would be very beneficial to consumer states like Kerala and Puducherry. 
""We have to revolt against the Union Government for our rights. It is high time that the Government of India changes the ToR and includes Puducherry also in the ToR,"" Narayanasamy said. 
Representing Karnataka, Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said his state fully supports the views of other states. 
Karnataka was of the opinion that all progressive states, including perhaps all the southern states, have been 'disincentivised' by means of the ToR, he said. 
Kerala's Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac in his opening remarks said it was estimated that Kerala was bound to lose around Rs 80,000 crore due to the present ToR. Related Article ",english

By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Updated: April 11, 2018 6:16:10 am Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 
THREE non-BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry Tuesday expressed serious reservations on the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry said that the ToR contradicted the principles of federalism and more non-BJP ruled states would be involved to debate the issue. 
The ToR, the states argued, would lead to states with higher population bagging a larger share of tax resources and a loss for states that have pursued population control. 
Responding to these concerns, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , in a statement, denied bias and said that Finance Commissions use both qualitative and quantitative criteria such as population and income level to decide financial needs and allocations to states. 
After the meeting, Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac said the issue is not a dispute between the South and North. Isaac said the terms of reference of the 15th FC are a threat to the federal system. 
“There is a deliberate attempt to cut down tax devolution to the states and forcibly impose conditions on the states. The states have to get consent from the Centre for borrowing funds from the market. The Finance Commission is a Constitutional structure to share finances of the country between the Centre and the states. What is being given from the FC should not be depicted as largesse of the Centre,’’ he said. 
The next meeting will be held in Visakhapatnam early next month, in which Delhi, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab are also expected to take part. There will also be attempts to bring in Telangana and Tamil Nadu for the next conclave, said Isaac. Today’s meeting was attended by Karnataka, Andhra and Puducherry, apart from host Kerala. 
While the terms of reference for the 14th Finance Commission were to use the 1971 Census data for determining devolution of taxes, duties and grants-in-aid; the Central government asked the 15th Finance Commission’s ToR to use the 2011 data. Southern states argue that this is expected to result in higher devolution of resources to states whose population have grown faster since 1971. 
Trying to to allay fears of these southern states, Jaitley said that the ToRs of 15th FC rightly balance both the “needs” represented by latest population and “progress towards population control” very well. A term of reference has also been added to recognize states which have done well on population control and to achieve replacement rate of population growth, Jaitley said. 
Jaitley said a needless controversy was being sought to be created that the ToR was loaded against any particular region of the country. “Nothing could be further from truth,” he said. The share in Central taxes is allocated to states based on recommendations made by the Commissions to help them provide a minimum standard of services to their people, he said. 
“This calls for assessing states’ ‘needs’ on rationale and equitable basis. FCs use appropriate criteria to assess true needs of States. Population proxies very well for the needs of the people in quantitative sense. Another criterion, the Income Distance, which captures very well relative poverty of people in the States, is used to assess qualitative needs. These two parameters allocate more resources to the populous and poorer States, which need additional funds for providing education, health and other services to the people, which own resources of these poorer states may otherwise not allows,” Jaitley added. 
In determining states’ share of taxes, the 14th Finance Commission had given 17.5 per cent weight to 1971 population and 10 per cent weight to 2011 population. A 50 per cent weight was given to income distance, which measures the distance of state’s income from the state having the highest income. The remaining weight was given to smaller states area, forest cover and general issues. 
Although the 14th Finance Commission had no specific mandate for using 2011 Census, Jaitley said, it rightly used the 2011 Census to capture the demographic changes since 1971 to make a realistic assessment of the needs of the states. The 14th Finance Commission had allocated a 42 per cent share in Central taxes to states. 
But Karnataka Agriculture Minter Krishna Byre Gowda, who is also a member of the GST council, said that all progressive states have been disadvantaged. “We endorse the opinion that the freedom ought to have vested with the finance commission to arrive at rightful formula for allocation rather than restrict the constitutional right of the finance commission through the terms of reference.’’ 
He said that under the incentives clauses, states which will reach the replacement fertility rate of 2.1 will also get these incentives. “That means those states which have already crossed the replacement fertility rate below 2.1 per cent would not get the incentives. That means, all the progressive states, which did their nationalistic duty called by the nation to bring down the population rate now or which did bring down the population, are not only going to lose from the decision to use the population data of 2011, instead of population of 1971, as the base for tax devolution.’’ 
Gowda said highly discretionary and subjective provisions were created in the ToR. “The state legislatures and the electorate are the deciders on what is profligacy or what is a not profligacy. Elections would deliver that message and the constitutionally that mandate rests with the legislatures and the electorate. Curtailing those rights are against the Constitution,’’ he said. 
“If you are making progress on your own, you should not be getting incentives. That would end up in penalizing progress,’’ said Gowda, referring to the terms of reference of the Commission. 
Said Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanaswamy, who is also handling the finance portfolio: “The Centre is not giving incentives to states which have population control. This is the biggest anomaly. The PM says under-developed states have to be developed. But development in such states should not be at the cost of developing states.’’ 
Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Rama Krishnudu said the Central Government should not be a dictator while deciding the ToR. “As per the Constitution, the Commission has to establish its own procedure and own way of doing things as far as distribution of revenue to states is concerned. But here the Government of India has given the terms of reference. That is why we are opposing it. These terms are likely to suppress the state’s financial powers,” he said. 
Earlier, inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the “conspicuous bias” in the ToR would prevent the Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. “Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,” Vijayan added.

""We have decided to prepare a joint memorandum on the manner in which the Finance Commission should go about things and take different states into confidence,"" Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac told the media here.

The Finance Commission -- which delves into the financial relations between the Centre and states -- should be guided more by its constitutional mandate than arbitrary terms of reference, Vijayan said. ""... (there is) a conspicuous bias in-built in the terms of reference of the new commission. It is widely feared that these terms framed by the Centre will prevent the panel from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility,"" Vijayan added. Apart from Vijayan and Issac, those who attended the workshop were Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Rama Krishnudu and other top officials. Representatives from Telengana and Tamil Nadu were absent. Vijayan said all states should appeal to the central government to reframe the terms of reference. ""The reframing of the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country and to reinforce its unity and integrity,"" said Vijayan, a senior Communist Party of India-Marxist leader from Kerala. Vijayan said the commission's role assumes significance, given the fact that the Centre is given near monopoly over the right to mobilise resources. ""We are all aware that the terms of reference have created apprehension about the principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in devolution of financial powers and resources to the states by the Centre,"" the Chief Minister added. Vijayan expressed reservation over the Financial Commission proposal for ""measurable performance-based-incentives"" which he claimed was an attack on the federal structure of the Indian state. ""Such terms of reference, we fear, might end up altering the commission's status from a constitutional authority entrusted with devolution of national fiscal resources to an administrative mechanism for fiscal administration and monitoring,"" added Vijayan. Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, in his address, said all states that performed their duty of bringing down the population in their respective jurisdictions, were set to lose out since the plan is to shift the base from 1971 to 2011 Census. Ramakrishnudu flayed the Centre for alleged arbitrary manner in fixing the commission's terms of reference. Puducherry's Narayanasamy, who also holds the finance portfolio, complained that when it came to central schemes, the Union government treated Puducherry as a state but with regard to grants it was treated as a union territory. -- IANS (1 hour ago)",english

Three non- BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry today came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states here, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states. Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions. 
However, AIADMK ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR. 
“We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Orissa, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference, Isaac said. Stating that all states would be affected, he said BJP ruled states were also welcome to the conference. However, he expressed doubt about their participation as ToR was drawn up by the BJP government at the Centre. The memorandum would be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said. 
On the outcome of today’s meet, he said the states, which participated, came together on several issues. They were of the view that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre’s share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said. “If this is allowed to succeed, states would become a glorified muncipalities,” Isaac added. The 15th Finance Commission was expected to visit the state in May, he said to a question. 
He also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations. Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the ‘conspicuous bias’ in-built in the ToR of the new commission. It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said. 
“Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,” Vijayan added. Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states. “We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,” the chief minister said. 
Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. “This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states’,” he said.

They were against ToR ‘unilaterally’ stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions. Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an ‘eye opener’ for the union government. Best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them. 
Narayanasamy also came down on the recommendation to do away with Central funds for ‘populous schemes’ of states. He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, ‘but what was actually happening is dictatorship”. “They want to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,” he added.

Undertaken by the State water transport department (SWTD), the first boat was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan at Panavally near Cherthala on Monday.
“The state has 1,700-km-long waterways. To exploit the trade potential, a special purpose vehicle was formed for their development. With the help of the Centre, the waterways will be developed, and it will pave the way for the industrial development of central Kerala,” Vijayan said at the launch, reports The New Indian Express .
Built at the cost of ₹50 lakh, the boat is on par with a modern ambulance with all kinds of paraphernalia required for rescue missions as well as basic medical care and can accommodate 20 passengers along with the crewmembers.

Compared to the normal boat speed of six knots, these vessels will function at the high speed of 12 knots, while providing medical service round the clock. The ambulance service will soon have a dedicated phone number, which will help the crew to rush to the locations upon getting alerts.

ഇതിനുംമുൻപ്‌ പെരുമാറ്റ വൈകല്യമുള്ള പോലീസുകാരെ നേർവഴി നടത്താൻ പോലീസ് മേധാവി തുടങ്ങിയ നിർബന്ധിത പരിശീലന പരിപാടി ഇപ്പോഴും തുടരുന്നുണ്ടാവുമെന്നും കരുതട്ടെ. എന്തുകാര്യം? പോലീസ് അതിക്രമങ്ങൾക്കെതിരേ പൊതുസമൂഹത്തിൽ ശക്തമായ വികാരം അലയടിക്കുന്ന ഈ സമയത്തുതന്നെ കേരളത്തെ ഞെട്ടിച്ചുകൊണ്ട് ഒരു കസ്റ്റഡിമരണംകൂടി നടന്നിരിക്കുന്നു.
വരാപ്പുഴയിൽ ഒരു ഗൃഹനാഥന്റെ ആത്മഹത്യാസംഭവത്തോടനുബന്ധിച്ച് കസ്റ്റഡിയിലെടുത്ത ശ്രീജിത്ത് എന്ന 26-കാരൻ മരിച്ചിരിക്കുന്നു. പോലീസ് പിടിച്ചുകൊണ്ടുപോയ ഈ യുവാവിനെ അടുത്ത ദിവസം പോലീസ് തന്നെ ആശുപത്രിയിലെത്തിക്കുമ്പോൾ ജീവന്റെ തുടിപ്പുമാത്രമേ അവനിൽ ശേഷിച്ചിരുന്നുള്ളൂ. ക്രൂരമായ മർദനത്തിൽ ശ്രീജിത്തിന്റെ ആന്തരികാവയവങ്ങൾക്ക് ക്ഷതമേറ്റിരുന്നതായി മെഡിക്കൽ റിപ്പോർട്ടും പോസ്റ്റ്‌മോർട്ടം റിപ്പോർട്ടുമൊക്കെ വ്യക്തമാക്കുന്നുണ്ട്.
പോലീസ് എന്തൊക്കെ വ്യാഖ്യാനം നൽകിയാലും ഇത് കസ്റ്റഡിമരണമാണെന്ന കാര്യത്തിൽ സംശയങ്ങൾക്ക് ഇടമില്ലാത്തവിധമുള്ള തെളിവുകളാണ് പുറത്തുവരുന്നത്. ഇതിന്റെ അടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലാണ് മൂന്നു പോലീസുകാരെ സസ്പെൻഡുചെയ്തതും അന്വേഷണത്തിന് പ്രത്യേക സംഘത്തെ നിയോഗിച്ചതും.
സംസ്ഥാന മനുഷ്യാവകാശ കമ്മിഷൻ ആക്ടിങ് ചെയർമാൻ പി. മോഹനദാസ് ശ്രീജിത്തിനെ ആശുപത്രിയിൽ ചെന്നുകണ്ടതിന് ഏതാനും മണിക്കൂറുകൾക്കകമാണ് ആ ചെറുപ്പക്കാരൻ മരിച്ചത്. മർദനത്തിന്റെ രൂക്ഷത അദ്ദേഹത്തിന് നേരിട്ട് ബോധ്യപ്പെട്ടിട്ടുണ്ട്. അവിടെവെച്ച് അദ്ദേഹം പോലീസിനെ രൂക്ഷമായി വിമർശിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തു.
വീട്ടിൽനിന്ന് പിടിച്ചുകൊണ്ടുപോയപ്പോൾ വീട്ടുകാരുടെ മുന്നിലിട്ട്‌ പോലീസ് ശ്രീജിത്തിനെ ചവിട്ടിയെന്നും പരാതിയുണ്ട്. പോലീസിനെ ആധുനിക വത്കരിച്ചുവെന്നാണ് നമ്മുടെ ഭരണാധികാരികൾ എപ്പോഴും വീമ്പിളക്കുന്നത്. മുൻകാലങ്ങളിൽനിന്ന് വ്യത്യസ്തമായി വിദ്യാസമ്പന്നരായ ചെറുപ്പക്കാരാണ് നമ്മുടെ പോലീസ് സേനയിലുള്ളത്. എന്നിട്ടും കേരള പോലീസ് ഇപ്പോഴും പ്രാകൃതമായ സമീപനമാണ് സ്വീകരിക്കുന്നതെങ്കിൽ എന്ത് മാറ്റമാണ് ഉണ്ടായതെന്ന് ചിന്തിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്.
കസ്റ്റഡിമരണങ്ങൾക്ക് കേരള പോലീസ് ഉത്തരവാദികളാവുന്നത് ഇതാദ്യമല്ല. പല കേസുകളുടെയും വിചാരണ ദശാബ്ദങ്ങളായി നീണ്ടുപോകുന്നതിനാൽ ശിക്ഷിക്കപ്പെട്ടവർ അത്യപൂർവം. തങ്ങൾ ഉൾപ്പെട്ട കേസുകൾ അട്ടിമറിക്കാൻ പോലീസിന് നിഷ്‌പ്രയാസം കഴിയുമെന്നതിനാൽ ഇത്തരം സംഭവങ്ങളിൽ ഇരകൾക്ക് നീതി എപ്പോഴും അകലെയാണ് എന്നതാണ് കേരളത്തിലെ അനുഭവം. കുറ്റാന്വേഷണത്തിലും ജനസൗഹൃദപരമായ നടപടികളിലും പോലീസ് സേനയിൽ കഴിവും ആത്മാർഥതയുമുള്ള ഒരു കൂട്ടർ അഭിമാനകരമായ നേട്ടങ്ങൾ നേടുന്നുണ്ട്.
എന്നാൽ ഇതിനെയെല്ലാം നിഷ്‌പ്രഭമാക്കുന്നവിധം ക്രിമിനൽ മാനസികാവസ്ഥയുള്ളവരുടെ സാന്നിധ്യം കേരള പോലീസിൽ കുറവല്ലെന്ന് വ്യക്തമാക്കുന്ന പല റിപ്പോർട്ടുകളും പുറത്തുവന്നിട്ടുണ്ട്. പോലീസ് സേനകൾ പൊതുജന സൗഹൃദമാകുകയും ശാസ്ത്രീയമായി കുറ്റാന്വേഷണം നടത്താൻ ശാക്തീകരിക്കപ്പെടുകയും ചെയ്തുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നതാണ് ലോകത്തെങ്ങുമുള്ള അനുഭവം.
ശാസ്ത്രീയമായി കുറ്റം തെളിയിക്കാൻ ബുദ്ധിപ്രയോഗിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. ഇതിനുള്ള കഴിവില്ലായ്മയാൽ, ഇപ്പോഴും മൂന്നാംമുറ ശീലിക്കുന്ന പോലീസ് കേരളത്തിന് അപമാനം തന്നെ. കുറ്റം തെളിയിക്കാനുള്ള ആവേശത്തിൽ കൺമുന്നിലുള്ളത് മനുഷ്യജീവനാണെന്ന് മറന്നുപോവുന്ന ഈ ക്രൗര്യം നിയമപാലകർക്ക് ഉണ്ടായാൽ ജനജീവിതത്തിന് എന്താണ് സുരക്ഷിതത്വം?
പൗരന്മാരുടെ ജീവിതത്തോടും സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തോടുമുള്ള ഭരണകൂടത്തിന്റെ പ്രത്യക്ഷ അവഗണനയെന്നാണ് രാജ്യത്തെ ജയിലുകളിലെ കസ്റ്റഡി മരണങ്ങളെക്കുറിച്ച് സുപ്രീംകോടതി നിരീക്ഷിച്ചത്. ലോക്കപ്പിലെ കസ്റ്റഡി മരണങ്ങളുടെ കാര്യത്തിലും ഇതുതന്നെ പറയേണ്ടിവരും. ഏത് കൊടും കുറ്റവാളിയെ അറസ്റ്റ് ചെയ്യുമ്പോഴും മനുഷ്യാവകാശത്തെ മുൻനിർത്തി പാലിക്കേണ്ട സംഗതികൾ വ്യക്തമായി നിർവചിക്കപ്പെട്ടിട്ടുള്ള നാടാണിത്.
ഇവയിപ്പോഴും നഗ്നമായി ലംഘിക്കപ്പെടുന്നുണ്ടെങ്കിൽ അതിന്റെ ഉത്തരവാദിത്വം പോലീസിന് മാത്രമല്ല, പോലീസിനെ നിയന്ത്രിക്കുന്ന ഭരണകൂടത്തിനുമുണ്ട്. മനുഷ്യാവകാശങ്ങളുടെ സംരക്ഷകരാകേണ്ട പോലീസ് അത് ഹനിക്കുന്നവരായാൽ സർക്കാർ നോക്കിനിൽക്കുന്ന സ്ഥിതിയുണ്ടാവരുത്.
എന്നാൽ ഇതല്ല സമകാലീന കേരളത്തിന്റെ അനുഭവം. സമരങ്ങളെ അടിച്ചമർത്തുന്നതിനും ക്രമസമാധാന പാലനത്തിനും അതിക്രമമാണ് പോലീസ് കണ്ടിരിക്കുന്ന ഏകമാർഗം. ഇത് തിരുത്തേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. കേരള പോലീസിന് എന്തുപറ്റിയെന്ന ചോദ്യമാണ് ഇപ്പോൾ ഉയരുന്നത്. പ്രാകൃതമായ കസ്റ്റഡി മരണങ്ങൾ ഇനിയും കേരളത്തിൽ ആവർത്തിക്കാൻ പാടില്ല. കർശനമായ തിരുത്തലിലൂടെ മാത്രമേ അത് സാധിക്കൂ. നിയമപാലനം നേർവഴിക്ക് തന്നെ പോകണം.",malayalam

While distributing the relief fund to the families of 92 missing fishermen at Vettucaud here on Tuesday, Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government had overlooked technicalities while ensuring aid for Ockhi affected families. “We abandoned conventional routes. If we had followed existing rules, we would not have been able to help these families in a timely manner. There is no word that could comfort them and nothing would substitute the lives that were lost. But those were lives which once protected families, took care of their dear ones and the government had to act swiftly to take care of their family members,” said Pinarayi Vijayan. An amount of Rs 20 lakh each was distributed to dependants of 92 persons who went missing during Ockhi disaster. Deposit documents were handed over to family members of 92 missing fishermen. Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government would soon purchase three marine ambulances to assist rescue operations in future. “This will be purchased at a cost of Rs 18.24 crore of which BPCL and Cochin Shipyard have agreed to contribute partially from their corporate social responsibility funds. Minister for tourism and devaswom Kadakampally Surendran said that the state government has gone beyond all false allegations of delay and lapses and has reached out to the Ockhi victims like no other government could. “Even the central government agencies failed in giving proper warning ahead of Ockhi. The state government took lot of blame for that, but all those were false allegations propagated by certain opportunists who were keen on taking advantage of the adversity. A section of media had also tried to hide facts and portray the government in bad light,” said Kadakampally Surendran. Surendran said that the government acted in such a way that none of the beneficiaries had to wait in government offices to avail the aid. “The government literally took the help to their homes. Around 2,140 Christmas kits were distributed. Families of missing persons were given Rs 10,000 per month without fail,” said Kadakampally Surendran.  ",english

Read More Thiruvananthapuram: The conclave of finance ministers of southern states became a platform for unleashing an attack on the Centre’s financial policies as Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Left parties came out against the terms of reference (ToR) stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. Though the speakers said that there was no politics in the subject, the attack on the policies of BJP was very much palpable in their words. While Telangana and Tamil Nadu kept away due to political reasons, the representatives of participating states – Puducherry, Karnataka and Andhra – unleashed attacks on the fiscal policies pursued by the Centre. At the conclave, ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR contradicted the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution. They added that it will also pave the way for revenue loss for states having a good performance record. The move to replace 1971 census data with 2011 data for devolution of funds will be detrimental to all southern states, they said. The most-vehement critic was Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy who led the attack. Criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Narayanasamy said that Modi is interested in diluting powers. “PM says he believes in cooperative federalism. The definition of cooperative federalism, according to Modi, is to control states and dilute powers,” he said. Narayanasamy said that while the apex court chides states for not fulfilling poll promises, the Centre is asking states not to come up with populist schemes. Taking the specific case of his home state, he claimed that lieutenant governor of Puducherry, Kiran Bedi is only bothered about blocking all files she received. “It is high time that the interests of states are protected,” he said. Agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda, representing Karnataka, said that the 15th Finance Commission’s terms of reference would be a problem. “Population is a factor, but more than that, the terms of reference say that incentives will be given to states that are striving to achieve the fertility rate of 2.1. The southern states have already surpassed that target, which means that the incentive will also be denied to them,” he said, adding that categorizing programmes as populist was a subjective matter. Veteran TDP leader and finance minister of Andhra Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that the Centre decided on the terms of reference arbitrarily without consulting any state. “Around 80% of developmental activities are to be undertaken by states and a major share of the revenue from the states go to Centre,” he said.

The police in Kerala seem to be under the grips of a very malignant trend – to willfully resort to physical abuse with brute force on the citizens, and with every passing day, it seems to have no respite. 
The suspected custodial death of 26-year-old Sreejith who was initially accused of trespassing and assault in Varapuzha in Kochi on Monday is the latest episode to rock the state's home department, which is presided over by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself. 
What makes matters worse is the news which had emerged when this copy was being filed that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the Sreejith, who allegedly died under police custody, was not the person against whom a family in Varapuzha had filed a police complaint. The mother and father of Sreejith, who was allegedly killed in police custody in Kerala. Firstpost/Naveen Nair 
On Friday, 6 April, a group of 14 people had attacked the house of one 55-year-old Vasudevan over a local spat leading to his suicide a day later. But Vasudevan's son Vineesh said that the Sreejith who died under police custody was not among those who attacked his house. 
""We have not registered any complaint against this particular Sreejith neither do we know whether he had any role in the attack on our house. Our complaint was against another Sreejith, who is the son of one Sasi. I have not even seen the Sreejith who died under police custody. No idea why the cops picked him up,"" Vineesh told Firstpost. 
The presumably iron handed chief minister and his departmental top brass are now struggling to find answers to not just the alleged killing in police custody but also how an innocent young man got branded as a criminal and finally ended up in the cold mortuary of a government hospital. 
It also throws the police version out of the window that the grave internal injuries suffered by Sreejith were from a scuffle at Vasudevan's house. If Sreejith was not present in Vasudevan's house, then who could have inflicted the wounds on him? Could it have happened while trying to get a confession out of Sreejith while in police custody? 
The jury is still out as far as fixing the responsibility of Sreejith's death is concerned. But the events running up to his death has left a definite imprint of police excess. 
This has forced the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to file a suo motu case on the issue and condemn what it calls the barbarity of the force in unequivocal terms. 
""This is an absolutely inhumane act. Just because you wear the uniform does not mean you cannot be humane. I had personally visited the hospital and talked to the doctor who treated Sreejith. The doctor clearly said that 75 percent of Sreejith's small intestine or the jejunum had been ruptured, forcing whatever food he ate to spill into other body parts leading to septicemia. Such an injury can only be caused by extreme force in the abdominal region. This is a clear case of custodial torture,"" said P Mohana Das, acting chairperson of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC). 
The commission is not alone in pointing fingers at the men in khaki (police uniform). Sreejith's family said in one voice that the police had used brute force on the young man. 
Shyamala, Sreejith's mother is unable to hide her tears as she recounts the events of Friday night when a police team picked up Sreejith from his home without even saying what wrong he had done. 
""They beat him and kicked him in front of us when they came to take him into custody. From then on, we were scared that something will happen to him. Later on, when I went to the station the next morning, I saw him sitting on the bench clutching his tummy. He even asked me water. I tried to give it to him but the inspector did not allow it. Later on, we were told that he was in the hospital. I am certain the cops killed my son,"" a wailing Shyamala said. 
Violations all the way 
The postmortem report which was out by Tuesday evening clearly states that Sreejith had died due to septicemia, developed after his intestines had ruptured following intense pressure on his abdomen or in medical parlance 'blunt trauma to abdomen' – something that will make it very tough for the cops to wriggle out of the case. The report had also suggested that the cause of death was cardiac arrest due to immense stress. 
The SHRC, which had asked the state director general of police (DGP) to file a report at the earliest had also pointed out the gross violation of Supreme Court guidelines by the policemen while taking Sreejith into custody. 
For starters, there is no clarity when or whether Sreejith's arrest was ever recorded. He was picked up around 10:45 pm on Friday and till he was taken to the hospital in the wee hours of Sunday morning with acute pain in the abdomen, police had kept Sreejith inside the station – a detention of well over 24 hours without an arrest, as per the findings of the Commission. 
""This is a clear case of violation of all possible norms which need to be followed when an individual is taken into police custody. Why did the police not take him to a hospital for medical examination, something that needs to be done before an arrest? Why were his relatives not informed about his condition if at all they were planning to arrest him? And above all, why did they not produce him before a magistrate even after 24 hours? So, it is an illegal detention which is a violation of basic human rights,"" the commission pointed out. 
Meanwhile, a visibly shaken DGP who met media persons at Thiruvananthapuram has said that the case is a very serious and would be probed by a Special Investigation Team (SIT). 
""I have complete empathy for the mother of Sreejith and what she has said. It is a very serious allegation against the police which will be investigated threadbare by a team that has a track record of very high credibility. We will get to the bottom of this and will not spare anyone,"" said Lokanath Behera, DGP, Kerala Police. 
The police, meanwhile, is doing everything it can to counter the claim of mistaken identity. It even brought up a counter-claim late into Tuesday evening that Vineesh's statement was recorded in the presence of Sreejth and that Vineesh had identified him as well, something which the latter said is baseless. 
Political fallouts 
The political ramifications of Sreejith's custodial death could be highly damaging for the ruling Left Front. For one, he is a BJP local worker and secondly, as of now, he seems innocent having nothing to do with the crime that he has been accused of. 
With the Chengannur bypolls to be held soon, the BJP will for sure make this an election issue. 
""Obviously, this will be an election issue in Chengannur. The people should know the real face of Vijayan and his police. Never in the history of the state has a situation come where a junior officer and policemen do whatever they want in spite of the DGP's orders for restraint. It shows that police stations across Kerala are run by local CPM leaders who are Vijayan's men and not by the system. This is atrocious,"" MS Kumar, state BJP spokesperson, said. 
BJP's allegations find echo inside the CPM as well. In the last state conference of the party at Thrissur, Vijayan, considered the numero uno in the party, himself took tremendous flak for the way the home ministry had been conducting itself. 
Even inside the Left Front, the coalition partners have been highly critical of the conduct of the men in uniform and the inability of the chief minister to successfully apply the Left's policy of governance in the home department. But nothing has changed since then, nor anyone has raised dissent to the police's functioning. 
""See, not just in the CPM's state conference but even in the CPI state conference there was strong criticism from within the party on how the home department was being run. But the issue here is who will bell the cat? Vijayan is still the omnipotent force who has created a structure in the party where hardly a voice is raised against his style of functioning. Even the CPI, apart from making a few noises, shies away from an open debate. Add to this the gross inefficiency of Vijayan as an administrator, you have this terrible state of affairs,"" Joseph C Mathew, noted political commentator told Firstpost. 
The Congress too is on a war path regarding the police excesses in the state. Thrice the party-led Opposition had stalled the state Assembly over various issues related to the state police's excesses, forcing the chief minister to concede on more than one occasion that that the police had indeed gone overboard with their highhandedness. 
""Since this government came to power, police brutality has become the order of the day. But hardly any action has been taken. That is why the Congress party strongly feels that the need of the hour is to investigate Sreejith's death with help of an independent agency. There is no trust in a police investigation,"" said VD Satheesan, vice-president of the Congress party in Kerala. 
The latest update in the case is that three policemen, who had gone to take Sreejith into custody, have been suspended. This raises the suspicion whether the action was being taken against the cops for taking into custody the wrong person and is the police finally acknowledging that a mistake was made? 
That no action has been taken against the sub-inspector or others present in the station while he was allegedly tortured is being explained with the excuse of an ongoing investigation.

Singh (second from left) and other members of the panel. (Photo: PTI) Three non- BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry today came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states here, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states. Among other things, they also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 census to calculate population for allocation of union tax revenue in place of 1971 census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions.
However, AIADMK ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR.
“We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Orissa, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference, Isaac said. Stating that all states would be affected, he said BJP ruled states were also welcome to the conference. However, he expressed doubt about their participation as ToR was drawn up by the BJP government at the Centre. The memorandum would be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said.
On the outcome of today’s meet, he said the states, which participated, came together on several issues. They were of the view that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre’s share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said. “If this is allowed to succeed, states would become a glorified muncipalities,” Isaac added. The 15th Finance Commission was expected to visit the state in May, he said to a question.
He also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations. Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the Commission was unprecedented because of the ‘conspicuous bias’ in-built in the ToR of the new commission. It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the Central Government would prevent the Finance Commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said.
“Therefore, it is only proper for all of us to appeal to the Union Government to reframe the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission,” Vijayan added. Vijayan said introduction of GST in the country has resulted in erosion of fiscal autonomy of the states. “We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission has created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,” the chief minister said.
Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. “This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the the fiscal domain of states’,” he said. Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition.
They were against ToR ‘unilaterally’ stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said, and demanded that it be reframed after discussions. Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the conference would be an ‘eye opener’ for the union government. Best performing states are punished and worst performing ones are rewarded, he said, and sought to know how developed states could carry out works if funds were not given to them.
Narayanasamy also came down on the recommendation to do away with Central funds for ‘populous schemes’ of states. He took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , saying he talks about co-operative federalism at all meetings, ‘but what was actually happening is dictatorship”. “They want to impose (various things) on states in the name of the Constitution, but actually infringe on the powers of the states,” he added.
On GST, he said there was a 30 per cent decline in revenue of the Union Territory after implementation of new tax regime, though it had been repeatedly said GST would be very beneficial to consumer states like Kerala and Puducherry. “We have to revolt against the Union Government for our rights. It is high time that the Government of India changes the ToR and includes Puducherry also in the ToR,” Narayanasamy said.
Representing Karnataka, agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said his state fully supports views of other states. Karnataka was of the opinion that all progressive states, including perhaps all the southern states, have been ‘disincentivised’ by means of the ToR, he said. Isaac in his opening remarks said it was estimated that Kerala was bound to lose around Rs 80,000 crore due the present ToR.

Three non-BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states held in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry said that the Terms of Reference (ToR) was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states. 
The ministers from the four southern states also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 Census to calculate population for allocation of Union tax revenue in place of 1971 Census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions. 
However, AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS-ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR.

""We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference,"" Isaac said. Stating that all states would be affected, he said BJP-ruled states were also welcome to the conference. 
However, he expressed doubt about their participation as ToR was drawn up by the BJP government at the Centre. The memorandum would be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said. 
Since its formation in November 2017 , the 15th Finance Commission has been a matter of contention among the southern states. The Finance Commission is a crucial constitutional set-up which decides every five years the ratio in which Central tax revenue should be divided among the different states. 
All the states and Union Territories in India are collectively allocated 42 percent of the Central taxes collected each financial year. The remaining 58 percent is for the Centre to use for national purposes. But the ratio in which the 42 percent gets divided among the different states is decided by the Finance Commission. On 27 November, 2017, the Ministry of Finance issued a notification constituting the 15th Finance Commission under the chairmanship of NK Singh. 
In the same notice, one of the ToR stated that the ""Commission shall use the population data of 2011 while making its recommendations"". Traditionally, the previous Finance Commissions used population data from the 1971 Census as a standard. In fact, Lok Sabha constituencies were also divided based on this data and are set to remain frozen this way until 2026. The reason the 1971 Census was used as the standard is as it was the last Census before aggressive family control initiatives were implemented. 
After Tuesday's meeting, there were few who thought that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre's share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said. ""If this is allowed to succeed, states would become glorified municipalities,"" Isaac said. The 15th Finance Commission is expected to visit the state in May, he said. Issac also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations. 
The North-South debate 
The decision to include 2011 Census was first introduced in the 14th Finance Commission , which gave a 10 percent weightage to the 2011 Census while allocating the Central tax revenue. Like this piece in The Wire noted, the political consensus was that the ratio of distribution cannot be arrived at based on current population after asking states to implement family planning measures . 
The argument the southern states are making is that in the decades between 1971 and 2011, these states saw a steady decline in population growth rate, whereas northern states showed no such sign. The contention made by leaders like MK Stalin and Siddaramaiah is that using the 2011 Census data would result in a much-reduced flow of Central funds to the state, which they term as ""punishment"" for investing in education and health schemes to reduce the fertility rates and see an uptick in literacy rates. 
""We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission have created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,"" Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Tuesday while inaugurating the conclave. Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. 
""This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the fiscal domain of states',"" he said. Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition. They were against ToR 'unilaterally' stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said and demanded that it be reframed after discussions. 
One of the ToR asks the Finance Commission to incentivise ""efforts and progress made in moving towards replacement rate of population growth"". Joint secretary of the 13th Finance Commission V Bhaskar noted in The Economic and Political Weekly that the replacement level fertility rate is defined as the total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.1. Out of the 29 states in India, 18 have already achieved the desired replacement rate of 2.1 or less, including all the southern states. 
Female literacy rates in states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu are much higher than in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This shows a correlation between education and health; states with better literacy seem better prepared to implement family planning measures. 
As The Wire noted in its report , between 1971 and 2011, Tamil Nadu and Kerala showed an absolute population growth of 56 percent and 75 percent respectively — the lowest among all the states. Most other states showed an increase in the population growth exceeding 100 percent. Uttar Pradesh's showed an absolute population growth of 138.02 percent, while Jammu and Kashmir recorded the highest at 171.82 percent. 
When the 14th Finance Commission introduced the change in ratio by including the 2011 Census data, it translated to a revenue loss of Rs 6,000 crore for Tamil Nadu, 19 percent compared to the 13th Finance Commission's allocation ratio, making it the worst affected state. If the 2011 Census data is solely used by the 15th Finance Commission, it could result in a loss of nearly 70 percent of Central tax revenue it was allocated by the 13th Finance Commission, the report further stated. 
In a statement on Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley termed the controversy over the finance commission’s recommendations “needless” . The Union finance minister pointed out that the 14th Finance Commission, which increased the share of states’ revenue to 42 percent from 32 percent, had already set a precedent by giving 10 percent weightage to the 2011 census data. He added that the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission includes a provision for rewarding with special incentives states that have done well in terms of population control. ""There is no inherent bias or mandate in the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission which can be construed as discriminatory against the states which made good progress in population control,"" Jaitley said.

ജനങ്ങളെ ഇങ്ങനെ തല്ലല്ലേ പൊലീസേ; രണ്ടുവര്‍ഷം മര്‍ദിച്ചൊതുക്കിയത് 26 പേരെ 
‘ചവിട്ടുനാടകം’ ബൂട്ടിട്ട് 
പക്ഷേ, അങ്ങനെ ചിരിച്ചുതള്ളാവുന്നതല്ല ഈ പ്രശ്നം. ജനങ്ങൾക്കു സുരക്ഷയൊരുക്കാൻ ചുമതലപ്പെട്ട നമ്മുടെ പൊലീസ് സേന, ജനത്തിന്റെ മുതുകത്തു കയറി ബൂട്ടിട്ടു ചവിട്ടുനാടകം കളിക്കുന്ന കാഴ്ചയാണു നമ്മൾ ഒന്നിനുപുറകെ ഒന്നായി കാണുന്നത്. കേരള പൊലീസ് ഇത്രയും പ്രതിക്കൂട്ടിലായ ചരിത്രമില്ല അടുത്തകാലത്തൊന്നും. 
ഓരോസംഭവത്തിലും ആദ്യം പ്രത്യേക സംഘത്തിന്റെ അന്വേഷണം, പിന്നീട് ആരോപണവിധേയർക്കു സ്ഥലംമാറ്റം, എന്നിട്ടും പിടിച്ചുനിൽക്കാൻ പറ്റിയില്ലെങ്കിൽ സസ്പെൻഷൻ. ഇതാണ് ഇപ്പോഴത്തെ പൊലീസ് ഭരണരീതി. 
പറച്ചിൽ തെറി(യല്ല), പ്രവൃത്തി ഇടി(യല്ല) 
ഇതിനിടെയാണു പൊലീസിനെ നന്നാക്കാൻ സംസ്ഥാന പൊലീസ് മേധാവി ലോക്നാഥ് ബെഹ്റ ചെപ്പടിവിദ്യ ഇറക്കിയത്. സംസ്ഥാനത്തെ എല്ലാ പൊലീസുകാർക്കും ഒരു മണിക്കൂർ നല്ലനടപ്പു പരിശീലനം. ‘സേനയുടെ ഔദ്യോഗിക ഭാഷ തെറിയല്ല, പെരുമാറ്റം ഇടിയല്ല’ എന്നതായിരുന്നു വിഷയം. 
എല്ലാ സ്റ്റേഷനിലും നിർബന്ധമായി പരിശീലനം നൽകണമെന്ന ഉഗ്രശാസന. വാർത്ത വായിച്ച ജനം ചിരിച്ചാൽ തെറ്റില്ല. എന്നാൽ, തങ്ങളെ മാന്യത പഠിപ്പിക്കാൻ വന്ന എസ്ഐമാരെയും മേലുദ്യോഗസ്ഥരെയും കണ്ടു പല സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിലും പൊലീസുകാരുടെ കൂട്ടച്ചിരിയായിരുന്നു! 
പൊലീസിനെന്താ പണി? 
കേസ് അന്വേഷണവും ക്രമസമാധാന പാലനവും ആണെന്നു മറുപടി പറയാൻ വരട്ടെ. കടലാസിൽ അതൊക്കെയാണ്. പക്ഷേ, നമ്മുടെ പൊലീസിനു വേറെ നൂറുകൂട്ടം പണി കിടക്കുന്നു. 
∙ വാഹനം പരിശോധിച്ചും മദ്യപൻമാരെ പിടിച്ചും പെറ്റിക്കേസുകളുടെ എണ്ണം പെരുപ്പിക്കണം. അതിനു മേലുദ്യോഗസ്ഥരുടെ സമ്മർദം. 
∙ നേതാക്കൾ അടക്കമുള്ള വിഐപികളുടെ സുരക്ഷയും മന്ത്രിമാരുടെ യാത്രാ അകമ്പടിയും. ഒരു പൈലറ്റ് ജീപ്പുമായി യാത്ര ചെയ്ത മുൻ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി കെ. കരുണാകരനെ വിമർശിച്ചവർ ഇന്നു മൂന്നും നാലും ജീപ്പുകളുടെ പൈലറ്റും എസ്കോർട്ടുമായാണു യാത്ര ചെയ്യുന്നത്. മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ പോകുന്ന വഴിയിൽ ഈച്ച പറക്കാൻ പൊലീസ് സമ്മതിക്കില്ല! 
∙ റോഡിൽ കല്ലിടണമെങ്കിൽ, പൈപ്പ് ലൈനിന്റെ പാത ഒരുക്കണമെങ്കിൽ, ബൈപാസിന്റെ അലൈൻമെന്റ് നിശ്ചയിക്കണമെങ്കിൽ ഒരു കമ്പനിയിൽ കുറയാത്ത പൊലീസ്, ഗ്രനേഡും ലാത്തിയുമായി കാവൽ വേണം! 
യജമാനന്മാരും ഉപദേശികളും 
സിപിഎമ്മിന്റെ ഏതെങ്കിലും തട്ടിലെ സെക്രട്ടറിമാരുടെ കത്തോ ശുപാർശയോ ഇല്ലാതെ എസ്ഐ മുതൽ ഡിജിപി വരെ നിയമിക്കപ്പെടുന്നില്ലെന്നതാണു സ്ഥിതി.

Kay Benedict | Updated: April 11, 2018, 12:59 PM IST Sitaram Yechury's (right) political line has been vehemently opposed by the party's Kerala unit, along with Politburo member Prakash Karat. Ahead of its crucial 22nd Congress in Hyderabad (April 18-22), factional strife appears to have intensified in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) with a section led by former general secretary Prakash Karat and powered by the Kerala lobby, making all-out efforts to oust incumbent Sitaram Yechury and get former Tripura CM Manik Sarkar elected as general secretary instead. But Yechury, seeking re-election, is no pushover. His supporters are also keenly monitoring the situation. The Central Committee, comprising around 90 members, elects the new general secretary. The five-day Congress, the top decision-making body of the CPM, will also fine-tune its future political-tactical line, apart from electing a new general secretary — the party’s top official. Plans are also afoot to garner support and vote out Yechury’s amendment to the draft tactical-political line calling for electoral understanding with all secular forces (including the Indian National Congress) to defeat the BJP. The Karat group had succeeded in defeating Yechury’s resolution at the recent Central Committee meeting in Kolkata. However, the party Congress could go in for course correction with hundreds of delegates expected to move amendments. It is apparent that the party has learnt no lessons from its devastating defeat in Tripura last month when the last Marxist bastion in the country (Kerala alternates between the LDF and the UDF) was annexed by the BJP with ease. Instead of addressing the serious existential crisis the party is facing, the party Congress is expected to see renewed factional and proxy wars between Yechury and the powerful Kerala lobby led by Karat and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. A script is being written, which some CPM watchers believe is out of pique, to scuttle Yechury’s chances of getting a second term at the helm. Indications to this effect have emanated from a meeting of available Politburo members in New Delhi on Monday. It appears that instead of ironing out differences over the political-tactical line, factional leaders are busy canvassing support for the next general secretary. Sources said that at the Politburo meeting, a senior leader argued beyond the draft resolution to reaffirm the Karat camp’s stand of no understanding with the Congress and even the regional parties. Earlier, Politburo members like Brinda Karat (70), BV Raghavulu (67) S Ramachandran Pillai (80) were in the reckoning as Yechury’s successor. While age is not on Pillai’s side, Raghavulu is a novice vis-a-vis Yechury. And in Brinda’s case, charges of nepotism may be levelled as she is the spouse of Prakash Karat. That is how the idea of projecting 69-year-old Manik Sarkar who, the Kerala faction and its supporters believe could pip Yechury, came up. Party constitution allows a general secretary a maximum of three consecutive terms. Karat was re-elected for a third term in 2012, enabling him to helm the party for almost 10 years between 2005 and 2015. It is intriguing as to why the Kerala faction is adamant on foiling Yechury’s bid for re-election for a second term. Among current crop of leaders, Yechury is in the mould of late Harkishan Singh Surjeet, who was proactive in stitching up broad anti-BJP coalitions in 1996 and 2004. Some in-house critics question the choice of Manik Sarkar, who has a clean image but had failed to stop the BJP juggernaut in Tripura. Many leaders from West Bengal rue that if he had brought all anti-BJP forces, including the Congress, together the results would have been different. In the 2013 Assembly elections, the BJP polled less than 2 percent of the vote and all of its candidates, save one, lost their deposits. In sharp contrast in March this year, the BJP vote share zoomed to over 43 percent with 35 seats, while the CPM bagged just 16 seats securing 42 percent votes. It is apparent that an anti-BJP alliance could have tilted the scale in reverse order. Another factor for the defeat in the hill state, critics say, is Sarkar’s failure in reading the writing on the wall and connect with the youth, especially the millennials. Joblessness was a critical issue, with Tripura topping the list of states and UTs with the highest unemployment rate in the country. Even some students affiliated with the Left had switched to the saffron camp. Last year, the ABVP managed to secure 27 seats in the student council polls in as many as 22 government-run colleges in the state even as Sarkar remained sanguine. Can such a leader enthuse the cadre and revive the sinking fortunes of the CPM at national level? The Central Committee and Politburo are dominated by members from Kerala and West Bengal in that order, followed by Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Andhra, Telangana and Maharashtra. As of now, the Electoral College is evenly poised and that is why hectic canvassing is going on for the general secretary’s post. On Tuesday, Karat flew to Agartala to drum up support for Sarkar. Sources said before his visit, CITU (CPM labour wing) president K Hemalata, a Karat camp follower, was despatched to lobby support for their candidate. Now, all eyes on the Hyderabad Congress.

Read More THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The conclave of finance ministers of southern states became a platform for unleashing an attack on the Centre’s financial policies as Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Left parties came out against the terms of reference (ToR) stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. Though the speakers said that there was no politics in the subject, the attack on the policies of BJP was very much palpable in their words. While Telangana and Tamil Nadu kept away due to political reasons, the representatives of participating states – Puducherry, Karnataka and Andhra – unleashed attacks on the fiscal policies pursued by the Centre. At the conclave, ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry opined that ToR contradicted the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution. They added that it will also pave the way for revenue loss for states having a good performance record. The move to replace 1971census data with 2011 data for devolution of funds will be detrimental to all southern states, they said. The most-vehement critic was Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy who led the attack. Criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Narayanasamy said that Modi is interested in diluting powers. “PM says he believes in cooperative federalism. The definition of cooperative federalism, according to Modi, is to control states and dilute powers,” he said. Narayanasamy said that while the apex court chides states for not fulfilling poll promises, the Centre is asking states not to come up with populist schemes. Taking the specific case of his home state, he claimed that lieutenant governor of Puducherry, Kiran Bedi is only bothered about blocking all files she received. “It is high time that the interests of states are protected,” he said. Agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda , representing Karnataka, said that the 15th Finance Commission’s terms of reference would be a problem. “Population is a factor, but more than that, the terms of reference say that incentives will be given to states that are striving to achieve the fertility rate of 2.1. The southern states have already surpassed that target, which means that the incentive will also be denied to them,” he said, adding that categorizing programmes as populist was a subjective matter. Veteran TDP leader and finance minister of Andhra Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that the Centre decided on the terms of reference arbitrarily without consulting any state. “Around 80% of developmental activities are to be undertaken by states and a major share of the revenue from the states go to Centre,” he said.

In India, the Constitution provides for the appointment of a Finance Commission every five years to recommend methodology to share resources such that the fiscal space of the constituents, especially the States, is well protected. 
The terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission are thus a matter of utmost importance to the resources available to the States of India. The terms of reference of this Commission have created apprehension among States about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of public resources for development. This article deals with some general matters of principle in this regard. Vital for unity 
First, Article 1 of the Constitution of India recognises India as a Union of States. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in the matter of devolution of powers and resources to the States by the Central government. The foremost objective of the Finance Commission is an equitable distribution of financial resources between the two units of the Union. 
Even a cursory glance at the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution shows that in the allocation of duties between the Centre and the States, fundamental tasks of enhancing human development, income growth, livelihoods, and protecting and sustaining the environment are entrusted to the States. However, although these major tasks of nation-building are the duty of the States, the resources to finance them are substantially controlled by the Centre. 
I emphasise this point: the States in India today neither have the resources to fulfil their tasks as laid down in the Constitution, nor do they have the right to raise such resources. The present situation is not because of the action or inaction of the States but is directly the consequence of Central government policy. 
There is thus a great asymmetry in India’s federal system. The Centre’s capacity to mobilise resources is far greater than that of the States, but the latter are required to undertake development expenditures that far exceed their revenue generating capabilities. The Constitution of India entrusts the Finance Commission with the responsibility of addressing this anomaly. So the basic mandate of the Finance Commission should be seen as that of deciding an appropriate quantum of unconditional devolution of resources from the Centre to the States, combined with more specific grants. 
The devolution of resources by the 15th Finance Commission assumes further significance in the current environment, in which the finances of States have received a double blow in the form of demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The freedom of States to raise resources has been restricted by the introduction of the GST. They now have hardly any major tax left with them to make a difference to State resources. Demographic differences 
Second, using the population data of 2011 as the base for tax devolution should not reduce the allocation of resources to States that have successfully reduced their rate of population growth. These States have incurred huge fiscal costs in order to achieve a lower population growth and healthy demographic indicators. They have made substantial investments on education, health and directly on family welfare programmes. Bringing down the rate of growth of population does not mean less expenditure for States. On the contrary, it creates new commitments by the States to those in the labour force and to senior citizens. 
Many States of India today have achieved a replacement rate of growth of population or have gone below that rate in a short span of time. An immediate effect of this is a sharp rise in the proportion of elderly in the population. The care of the elderly is the responsibility of State governments. The enhanced costs of such care must be considered by the Commission in making its awards and in deciding the population criterion to be used. 
Third, the current terms of reference go far beyond the constitutional mandate of the Finance Commission. Indeed, they intensify efforts to use the Finance Commission as an instrument of fiscal consolidation and to impose the ideological and economic agenda of the Central government on the States. It is not the task of a Finance Commission to recommend “road maps for fiscal management” or to impose its perception of what policies are good for the people of the States. That is for democratically elected State governments to decide. 
Fourth, this blatant interventionism finds further and dangerous expression in a statement that should not find a place in any list of terms of reference, that is: “the Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all.” Revenue deficits are offshoots of the path of development followed by States and cannot be brought down in the short term. For instance, Kerala’s human development achievements are built on its investments in the people – in social sectors, health and education in particular. Public expenditure on them is a large part of the government spending and it has not been easy to bring down revenue deficits despite higher tax efforts. To discontinue post-tax devolution of revenue deficit grants would go against the principle of cooperative federalism. 
Fifth, the terms of reference explicitly privilege the “committed expenditures” of the Centre. We should request the Commission to affirm its constitutional status and responsibility by upholding federalism and fiscal autonomy of the States. The Finance Commission should not take a “residual approach” to the question of vertical devolution. The approach should not be that of distributing what is left over after providing for the requirements of the Centre. Ideological agenda 
Sixth, the terms of reference are unprecedented in asking the 15th Finance Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and is an attempt to micro-manage the fiscal domain of the State governments. Let us not forget that in many spheres of activity, States have set the agenda for development. These sectors include health, education, forest management, public distribution of food, agricultural production — the list goes on. Such development was not because the concerned States received Central incentives. Best practices were created on their own initiative. 
Thus, for the Finance Commission to propose “measurable performance-based-incentives” is nothing short of an attack on the federal structure mandated by the Constitution. It is not the duty of the Finance Commission to venture into the realm of day-to-day governance. The elected governments of States will decide what policies are appropriate for our people. 
It is also not for the Finance Commission to declare this or that policy as “populist”. Any measure, from welfare pensions for the poor and weaker sections of the society to food assistance, can be termed as “populist” and recommended to be curtailed. This strikes at the root of a democratic polity in which State governments are free to implement welfare measures, albeit within conditions of fiscal responsibility. The fiscal argument 
Seventh, it is not correct that the fiscal space available to the Centre has shrunk following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The argument today that an increase in devolution from 32% to 42% led to a reduction of the fiscal space available to the Union government is not borne out by the evidence. In practice, when implementing the award of the 14th Finance Commission, the Union government cut allocations to several Centrally Sponsored Schemes in 2015-16. The cutback was almost equal to the amount received by the States as a whole on account of the rise in share of taxes and duties. Thus, there was no squeeze of the fiscal space available to the Union government, because it had protected itself. In fact, the total resources devolved from the Union to all States put together has been declining as a share of GDP for some years now. There is no ground for reducing the share of States in the vertical devolution. The presumption now appears to be that the relative responsibility for development is shifting from the States to the Centre. Such a presumption, if accepted by the Commission, would shrink the fiscal space of the States and expand that of the Union government. 
India’s great wealth rests in its diversity. To recognise this diversity is also to recognise that States will follow diverse paths of development. The Finance Commission must facilitate diversity and a democratic path of development by respecting principles of equity and fairness in allocating resources between the Centre and States in India.

The much-delayed roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) service of the Kochi Corporation will hit the waters this month. 
The civic body is waiting for the date of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to launch its prestigious service between Vypeen and Fort Kochi. 
A meeting of the corporation council, held on Wednesday, decided to entrust the task of operating the service to Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation Ltd (KSINC), a government-owned company. The meeting also decided to push the proposal for the setting up of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the operations of ferry as well as ro-ro service. 
Mayor Soumini Jain said she was in touch with the office of the Chief Minister to launch the service, which was the first of its kind. 
Speaking at the council meeting, Deputy Mayor T.J. Vinod said it was a dream-come-true moment for the civic body, which had spend around ₹19 crore for the service. 
He defended the decision to entrust the task of operating the service to KSINC as it was a government agency. All the operational and maintenance expense of two vessels, excluding the triennial dry-docking, would be borne by the KSINC and the profit would be shared between the two, he said. 
Opposition’s demand 
The Opposition councillors, including K.J. Antony, Benedict Fernandez and K.J. Prakashan, demanded that service should be launched without further delay and commoners should be excluded from the fare hike. Poornima Narayan, chairperson of the Education Standing Committee of the local body, criticised the civic administration for failing to approach the government with a complete vision document on the SPV. The civic body should complete the homework for the SPV and approach the government instead of sending a casual request, she said. 
Replying to the debate, Ms. Jain said the Finance Standing Committee was advised by experts in Kochi Metro Rail Limited, who had formed an SPV for the metro rail service, to obtain an in-principle approval for its formation. “The civic body has decided to pursue the formation of the body, which could oversee the operation of ferry services,” she said.",english

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president M.M. Hassan has called for a court-monitored probe into the case of custodial death of S.R. Sreejith. 
Addressing a news conference here on Wednesday , Mr. Hassan also demanded that murder charges should be framed against the police officers involved in the incident. It was shocking that the police took the 26-year-old person into custody on the basis of mistaken identity and tortured him to death. The incident revealed the disgraceful behaviour of the police. 
Only a court-monitored probe, Mr. Hassan said, would shed light into the case and bring the culprits to book. 
The State government had suspended three police officers to create a smokescreen following the public outcry. Even a proper inquiry was not conducted before taking the decision on the suspensions, he said. 
He demanded that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan relinquish the Home portfolio, owing moral responsibility for the incident.

He said that the state share of central resources should be increased from 42% (existing) recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. Inaugurating the conclave of finance ministers of southern states, Vijayan said that states neither have the resources to fulfil their tasks (as laid down in the Constitution) nor do they have the right to raise such resources. “The present situation is not because of the action of the states, but is directly the consequence of the policies pursued by Centre,” he said. The devolution of resources by the commission assumes further significance in the present environment as the finances of states have received a double blow in form of demonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), he said. He added that for the state, the purchasing power and economic activity – particularly in traditional and cooperative banking sectors – were severely affected by demonetisation. Vijayan said that the freedom of states to raise resources has been further restricted after the introduction of GST. “It was further restricted by the equal division of GST despite the recommendations of the chief economic adviser that states be allocated a higher share. GST has taken away the right of the states to design their own special initiatives in resource mobilization. They now have hardly any major tax left with them to make a difference to state resources,” he said. With respect to the devolution of resources, vertical devolution should not be brought down from 42% awarded by the 14thfinance commission. “States have lost much of the space for manoeuvring after the introduction of GST and equal division of GST. In this context, raising the share of divisible pool from 42% may be considered,” he said. Finance minister TM Thomas Isaac said that the terms of reference of the commission is contradictory in letter and spirit of the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution. The government’s view received the backing of the opposition with Ramesh Chennithala extending full support in this matter. He said that Centre should have dialogues with states before finalizing the terms of reference as each state has its own peculiar nature. He said that the Centre cannot penalize states that have performed well in all sectors.  ",english

It’s simple arithmetic: UP’s 22 crore people send 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha. Tamil Nadu, with a third of the population, has almost half as many MPs (39). Similarly, Kerala has a sixth of UP’s population but one-fourth as many seats. The founding fathers envisaged equal weightage for every vote. If that criteria were applied, the share of the four southern states and one union territory in the Lok Sabha would fall. To prevent the political disempowerment of the South, the number of Lok Sabha seats in each state was frozen in 1976, through the 42nd constitutional amendment. That decision, taken during the Emergency, was subsequently endorsed in 2000 and again in 2002. Until 2026, the political map of India stands frozen. The discrepancy in representation is evident from the fact that the country’s largest Lok Sabha constituency in 2014 had nearly three million voters, while the smallest had less than 50,000. In terms of population, the South’s share has declined by almost four per cent since 1972, the last time Lok Sabha constituencies were delimited state-wise. But, at least until 2026, it will continue to enjoy a 24 per cent share in the Lok Sabha. It will not be politically disempowered, any more than it was in 1972. By that same token, can the South be economically disempowered? Linking share of union tax revenue to the current population of each state, rather than that of 1971 (when delimitation was frozen), will cost the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra, Telengana and Karnataka heavily. After all, they have a larger share of the “grey” population to look after. The chief ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra and Puducherry have come out strongly against the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave held in Kerala this week, the finance ministers of the South (minus Tamil Nadu and Telengana) held that population-linked funding would undermine the spirit of federalism. In effect, successful family planning and education programmes which have resulted in low fertility rates and a superior human development index would boomerang on the South. Previous finance commissions have gone by the 1971 census, so the question of why the ground rules have changed is valid. The 14th Finance Commission gave a weightage of 10 per cent to population figures, based on the 2011 census. Estimates on just how much the South will lose vis-a-vis the North vary, but there’s no doubt that it will be badly hit. Even the 10 per cent population weightage criteria used by the 14th Finance Commission is believed to have cost Tamil Nadu Rs 6,000 crore. From the perspective of the South, it may appear that the North is using a demographic club to corner a larger share. One argument that has been put forward in favour of population-linked funding of states, is that no citizen should be penalised for having been born in a “disadvantaged” region. Everyone is entitled to “basic minimum services”. That same egalitarian logic can be applied to Lutyens’ Delhi (NDMC area) which has a population of 2.57 lakh (2011 census) and a budget of almost Rs 4,000 crore. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation has a budget of Rs 5,200 crore and a population of 1.7 million. The imperative of “basic minimum services” clearly does not apply here. Needless to say, the economists, who put forward the egalitarian argument, do not live in East Delhi. Prima facie, dis-incentivising population control in a time of overpopulation, shrinking resources and climate change, makes little sense. It also smacks of an unfair use of political clout. Indeed, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan saw a ‘conspicuous bias’ in the 15th Finance Commission. However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley observed that the inclusion of ‘efforts and progress made in moving towards replacement rate of population growth’ in the terms of reference, will allow the 15th Finance Commission to reward the progressive states. It is tempting to dismiss the dissonance in the southern states as being politically motivated, especially in an election year. But the fact is that the South has achieved superior human development indicators through enlightened leadership, notably in Tamil Nadu, where Periyar advocated a higher age at marriage and education for women as well as smaller families. Certainly, narrowing the gap between South and North is desirable because regional socio-economic disparities inevitably lead to political unrest. But it cannot be achieved by applying the “crab” logic, that is, pulling down the enterprising crab which seeks to crawl up and out of the prison. Further, to apply the population logic to the share of union taxes, when it is not applied to the electoral rolls, is a contradiction. Adequate weightage must be given to population stabilisation measures, as Arun Jaitley has said, so that the South does not suffer.

KOCHI: In a major setback to Left Democratic Front (LDF) government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Kerala High Court on Wednesday quashed the takeover of land belonging to Harrison Malayalam Limited. The court cancelled the acquisition of nearly 40,000 acres of land under the Land Conservancy Rules in 2013. In a reprimand to the government, the court observed that the government should not behave like Robinhood. The division bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran also reminded the government that individuals companies too have their rights.Counsel for the state government contented that the company resold the land that was leased to them. The company argued that the land in question could not be treated as leased land, as the company paid taxes regularly for the plot held in its possession. The court accepted Harrison’s position and set aside the government action.The division bench’s order comes on petitions filed by Harrisons and others.The law should not be violated for a populist measure, the court reminded the government. The court annulled an order issued by Special Officer MG Rajamanikyam taking over the land, which included thousands of acres owned by Harrisons Malayalam Limited which has several estates spread over eight districts in the state in possession. The company had been accused of acquiring the land using fraudulent means.Government took over the land on the basis of the Rajamanikyam report on the 38,000 acres of land possessed by Harrison and other big companies. The report had cited other foreign companies which had to cede the land in their possession following Independence. The takeover based on this report was earlier ratified by a single bench of the High Court. Harrisons filed an appeal against this verdict which was considered by the division bench led by the Chief Justice and the latest order issued. A report submitted earlier by state government’s Law Secretary had said land could not be confiscated as the plot held by Harrisons could not be treated as leased land. He cited the foreign exchange regulations act, FERA, and the Indian Independence Act to support his contention that these laws do not provide a takeover. Rajamanikyam’s recommendations violate statutory provisions, the Law Secretary asserted.",english

TRIVANDRUM: Kerala is finally acquiring the state’s first private medical college which has seen many political and legal fights over the past two and a half decades.The state cabinet on Wednesday approved a draft bill to take over the Academy of Medical Sciences and Kerala Cooperative Hospital Complex, which is neck-deep in debt despite taxing students heavily.The college and hospital complex was built on government land in the northern Kannur district in the early 1900s when the late K Karunakaran was the chief minister and dissident Communist leader MV Raghavan the cooperation minister.It was also a scene of many violent protests and subsequent seizure of its control by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which is now in power, during its earlier term and many a court battle.The Pariyaram Medical College or PMC as popularly known is a complex of seven institutions including nursing, pharmacy and public schools and a specialty hospital for cardiology.It now has some 2,000 employees, mostly CPM workers. The government plans to convert it into an autonomous institution details of which are not yet known.Its founders envisaged a 1,000 bedded super-specialty hospital with modern medical facilities and a teaching college under a charitable trust.The aim was to become the second biggest such hospital in India after New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) then. But the attempts by politicians to wrest its control hastened its fall.A WhatsApp message from the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the cabinet had decided to recommend Governor P Sathasivam to issue an ordinance facilitating the takeover.“This is for providing better healthcare facilities for the people of northern Kerala and fulfilling the need for a government medical college in the region,” it said.“The society that was running the hospital complex and the college had requested the government to take over as it was difficult for them to continue.” The CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government that succeeded the Karunakaran administration had taken over the college from the society headed by MV Raghavan in 1997. But the society got its control back when the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) returned to power in 2001 and after the regime change again in 2006; the CPM wrested the society allegedly by rigging elections.",english

Kerala Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac said here on Monday that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu have confirmed representation in the meeting.
Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Y Ramakrishnudu demanded more power for state governments, asserting that 80 percent of the development needs to be carried out by states.
Puducherry Chief Minister was the most vocal against the centre and said that the conference would be an eye-opener for the union government.
Inaugurating the conference, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the heated debates that followed appointment of the commission was unprecedented because of the ""conspicuous bias"" in-built in the ToR of the new commission.
Many southern politicians have drawn considerable attention to the fact that the terms of reference (ToR) for the Fifteenth Finance Commission (FFC), as drawn up by the Centre, have said the basis for the population counts relevant for the division of funds must be the 2011 Census and not, as it was in the past, the 1971 Census. ""Between 1971 and 2011, the population in Kerala has increased by 56% while the rise in northern states including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh has been over 150%"", he said.
The conference themes also cover Goods and Services Tax, release of grants to states and incentives to states based on populist schemes.
College Basketball Scandal Spreads To Kansas And NC State
At Kansas, the first allegation listed concerns a player who signed his letter to play for Kansas on November 9, 2016. In 2015, the indictment alleged, an unnamed coach informed an Adidas consultant, who has been identified as T.J.
The Commission should not venture to impose the ideological and economic agenda of the union government over the state governments, he said.
The Ministers said the Centre arbitrarily prepared the Terms of Reference, alleging a conscious effort to cut the Central share of taxes to the States.
A week ago, while on a hunger strike against the Centre over its failure to set up the Cauvery Management Board, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy had said, ""We will not compromise state's rights"".
Issac added that, hitherto, it was the Planning Commission that decided on the state's share from the central pool with regards to allocation under the plan expenditure, while the FC dealt with non-plan expenditure.
It was widely feared that the ToR framed by the central government would prevent the finance commission from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility, he said.
Karnataka finance minister Krisha Byre Gowda argued that the sudden change of population base would disrupt the state economy. Together, the four southern states and Puducherry would lose ~80,000 crore. There is no representative in FC15 who is familiar with state finances.
Kerala state finance minister Thomas Issac, who organised the meeting, claimed his state stood to lose at least ~20,000 crore if the new terms of reference are used. ""It should be doused before the southern flames scorch the federation"".",english

But on Thursday, the 12-year-old boy, who was born without hands and suffers from 90% disability, will embark on a different battle by sitting on a dharna in front of the district collectorate for his basic right for education.
The boy made the decision after his repeated requests to upgrade his school to a high school was turned down by the state government. He had pleaded that the Velimanna Government Mappila UP School was close to his house and he can continue studies if it was upgraded.
Though he has no hands, the boy had trained himself to write with his feet and had sent numerous letters to the who's who in the central and state governments, to no avail. ""I will have to stop my education if the school is not upgraded. It is not just my need but of my entire village as there is no government high school in our panchayat,"" said Asim, who has completed Class VII at the school which is just 250 metres away from his house.
Asim's father Mohammed Saeed said as Asim cannot walk on his own it would be difficult for the child to travel 6km to the lone aided high school in the panchayat.
Hundreds of people, including students from Velimannna, will participate in the collectorate march and dharna, which will be inaugurated by A P J M Sheik Dawood , grand nephew of former President A P J Abdul Kalam at 10am. Though Asim had personally met chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan last month, his demand was turned down by the chief minister.
Acting on a letter written by Asim, former chief minister Oommen Chandy had issued an order to upgrade his school to a UP school in 2014. Action committee office bearers said the government will not commit finances for the upgrade of the school as the Omassery panchayat has expressed its readiness to provide land for the playground and the PTA, along with other organisations, have promised funds for purchase of land required and to set up the needed infrastructure. Moreover, children from 22 scheduled caste colonies would also benefit from the move apart from the over 500 students from Velimanna who have been forced to travel long distances for high school education.
""Our fight is not against the government but for a just cause of a child with disabilities to continue his education,"" said Anantha Krishnan M, chairman of the core committee formed to support Asim.
Sarthaj Ahmed, convenor of the action committee said Asim would take his agitation to Thiruvananthapuram if the government does not take a positive decision on upgrading the school.
Asim had won the Ujjwala Balyam Award initiated by the state women and child development department.",english

At present, the 91-member Central Committee of the Communist Party of India-Marxist has 15 members from Kerala while four of the 16-member Politburo members are from the state. A knowledgeable source in the party told IANS that 175 leaders from Kerala will be attending the party Congress along with a large contingent of journalists from the party organ Deshabhimani. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan continues to have an iron grip over the state party and wields considerable clout among the national leadership. It was most likely that the state will get more representation in the newly constituted committees, the source added. Although Vijayan and General Secretary Sitaram Yechury do not share the best of relations (as was seen during a decision on aligning with the Congress at the national level), things will not be allowed to run loose when it comes to arriving at important decisions, said the source who did not wish to be identified. Everyone in the party knows that it is passing through a tough phase and it just cannot afford any difference of opinion to flare up, he said. Veteran politburo member S.

DH file photo.
After its successful drive for organic vegetables and palliative care, the ruling CPI(M) in Kerala is foraying into yet another campaign, this time against liquor and intoxicating drugs.
The left party is opening a new de-addiction and counselling centre in its stronghold Kannur, the politically volatile northern district, as part of its large-scale goal to cement its grassroots level support.
The Centre is envisaged as a platform to help people recover from the addiction to abusive substances through scientific treatment and counselling.
The opening of the party-sponsored de-addiction centre assumes significance in the wake of the LDF government drawing flak over its new liquor policy which facilitated reopening of some of the closed bars by the previous UDF government.
The declared liquor policy of the LDF is abstinence while the Congress-led UDF advocates total prohibition in a phased manner.
Located at Thazhe Chovva in the district, the Centre is coming under the aegis of the party-led 'Initiative of Rehabilitation and Palliative Care (IRPC).'
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would inaugurate the centre at a function tomorrow, CPI(M) Kannur district Secretary P Jayarajan said.
Detailing the significance of the move, he said the abuse of the contraband substance is on the rise causing alarm.
""Various kinds of new intoxicating substances are flooding the market attracting teenagers and youths. So, it is the need of the hour to check this social evil, from destroying our individuals, families and society, through people's movement,"" Jayarajan said in a Facebook post.
The party strongman said the IRPC has already been indulging in several awareness programmes against drug abuse and the new centre is an extension of the initiative.
With an aim to reach out to common people and strengthen its grassroots level base, the ruling CPI(M) has launched several initiatives ranging from organic vegetable cultivation to palliative care.
The state-wide drive promoting organic vegetables under the title 'Jaiva Jeevitham' had been a huge success.
The left party is also planning to open 1000 outlets of organic vegetables across the state during the coming 'Vishu' festival season.
The party volunteers have also built houses for poor, cleaned polluted water bodies and taken up waste management drives in various parts of the state to reach out to the masses.",english

The Church will distribute 100 boats,1500 educational kits and scholarship to the victims’ families and children over the next two years in the affected areas of Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha and Kollam. The program will benefit more than 1000 families of this region. * **Kerala Chief Minister Shri Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurating Believers Eastern Church 'Ockhi' relief event in Thiruvananthapuram* The launch was announced in presence of honourable *Shri. Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister, Kerala*, *Shri. Prof. P. J. Kurien*, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Thiruvananthapuram along with *Rev Dr. K. P. Yohannan*, Metropolitan, Believers Eastern Church.

Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister, Kerala**, *said*, *“Whereas the government is always doing its bit to help victims of such natural catastrophes, it is important that the civil society participants also contribute towards relief and rehabilitation measures. Our government appreciates and welcomes such initiatives and will extend all possible support for the successful roll-out and implementation of this project.”* * Cyclone Ochki had ravaged a large part of coastal Kerala late last year killing a large number of people besides leading to loss of property and means of livelihood for locals. Most of the affected families were of fishermen who not only lost their property and belongings to the cyclone, but also lost their only means of livelihood – their fishing boats. Through this programme Believers Eastern Church aims to reach out to and rehabilitate fishermen community and their families. Speaking on the occasion *Metropolitan Dr. K. P. Yohannan, Believers Eastern Church* said, “When I visited the site sometime back I realised that merely by giving clothes or food we would not be able to address the problem. Livelihood and education are the two most critical pillars of any social order. Over the next two years we will address these aspects and reach out to more such victims who need a little helping hand.” Church’s numerous other programmes have benefitted thousands of children, women, leprosy patients and victims of natural catastrophes by providing them education, counselling, health camps, medicines, hospitals, shelter, rehabilitation and clean drinking water. *About Believers Eastern Church* Believers Eastern Church is a Christian denomination with congregations and parishes worldwide. The Church at present has 30 Bishops who give spiritual and administrative leadership to the various activities of the Church.

[India], Apr. 13 (NewsVoir): Believers Eastern Church announced the launch of a state-wide rehabilitation program for the victims of Cyclone ""Ockhi"". 
The church will distribute 100 boats, 1500 educational kits and scholarship to the victims' families and children over the next two years in the affected areas of Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha and Kollam. The program will benefit more than 1000 families of this region. 
The launch was announced in presence of Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister, Kerala, P. J. Kurien, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Thiruvananthapuram along with Rev Dr. K. P. Yohannan, Metropolitan, Believers Eastern Church. 
Other eminent dignitaries like Mathew T Thomas, the Minister for Water Resource's, Govt. of Kerala; Mayor of Trivandrum, MLA of Thiruvananthapuram East were present. 
""Whereas the government is always doing its bit to help victims of such natural catastrophes, it is important that the civil society participants also contribute towards relief and rehabilitation measures. Our government appreciates and welcomes such initiatives and will extend all possible support for the successful roll-out and implementation of this project,"" said Chief Minister Vijayan. 
Cyclone Ochki had ravaged a large part of coastal Kerala late last year killing a large number of people besides leading to loss of property and means of livelihood for locals. Most of the affected families were of fishermen who not only lost their property and belongings to the cyclone, but also lost their only means of livelihood - their fishing boats. Through this programme Believers Eastern Church aims to reach out to and rehabilitate fishermen community and their families. 
""When I visited the site sometime back I realised that merely by giving clothes or food we would not be able to address the problem. Livelihood and education are the two most critical pillars of any social order. Over the next two years we will address these aspects and reach out to more such victims who need a little helping hand,"" said Yohannan. 
Church's numerous other programmes have benefitted thousands of children, women, leprosy patients and victims of natural catastrophes by providing them education, counselling, health camps, medicines, hospitals, shelter, rehabilitation and clean drinking water. (NewsVoir) SEARCH",english

Chennithala also alleged that Pinarayi Vijayan-led government was hesitant to take action against the Sub-Inspector of Varappuzha police station despite widespread condemnation from various quarters against police brutality towards Sreejith and his brother. ""Lock-ups in Kerala have become killing fields. Sreejith and his brother were subjected to brutal torture in police custody,"" Chennithala told reporters after meeting Sreejiths family in Varappuzha. The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly said Sreejith is the sixth victim of custodial torture after the CPI(M)-led LDF came to power in the state. All those policemen who were responsible for the death of Sreejith should be removed from service and should be tried for murder, Chennithala said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Seeking a probe by a district judge into the incident, Chennithala criticised the silence of the Chief Minister on the matter. Due procedures were not followed by the police for taking Sreejith and his brother into custody, he claimed. Three policemen were suspended on Tuesday in connection with the death of Sreejith in police custody, while a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the case. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Sreejith, who was taken into custody in connection with the death of a person last week, died in a private hospital on Monday evening. His relatives alleged that he died due to torture. Police have rejected the allegation of torture, saying Sreejith was suspected to have suffered injuries during a clash allegedly before he was taken into custody. DGP Loknath Behera has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the case following allegations that police harassment and torture caused death of Sreejith. BJP had observed a dawn-to-dusk hartal on Tuesday in Varappuzha Panchayat, protesting the death of Sreejith, who they claimed was a party worker. PTI TGB ROH MVV

The State will go ahead with the ongoing land acquisition initiatives for the proposed national highway widening works barring the stiff resistance from the affected group, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
“Kerala is warranted to take up major developmental initiatives such as the proposed national highway widening works by acquiring the relatively scarce land. However, a few group in recent times, have come in the open to oppose such moves and the State will be driven to overcome such resistance for the sake of future developmental aspirations,” Mr. Vijayan said while addressing a public function to inaugurate a newly constructed building of the Karadukka block panchayat at Karmamthodi here on Thursday. 
The Chief Minister’s observation came at a time when the State was witnessing stiff resistance against moves to level-up marked stretch of wetland areas in the Keezhattur paddy field near Taliparamba in Kannur and select pockets in Malappuram where the road realignment was mooted inviting sharp opposition from the local residents. 
“It is a fact that many people are holding scarce land. In such a scenario, people will be forced to hand over their precious land for the sake of development while the State is determined to ensure maximum compensation for the land used for developmental needs,” he said. 
He lauded four individuals for gifting one acre of land to facilitate the building for the local body. The four individuals had set a role model for the entire State by offering land free of cost and needed to be felicitated for their gesture, the Chief Minister said. 
Stating that the authorities concerned had managed to vest adequate land from the northern tip of Thalppadi to Kasaragod for the NH widening project, he said the Centre had expressed to make liberal compensation up to ₹6 crore for one km land for the NH project as against the tune of ₹65 lakh in other State, he said adding that Union Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had adopted favourable stance taking into account the ground realities in Kerala. 
Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, presiding over the function, felicitated Kunhiraman, Damodaran, Balakrishnanan and Sukumaran for coming forward to gift their land for the panchayat. 
The function was addressed by P. Karunakaran, MP; M. Rajagopalan, MLA; District Collector K. Jeevanbabu; representatives of various local bodies; besides senior district officials.",english

Written by Vishnu Varma | Kochi | Published: April 12, 2018 7:20:22 pm Sreejith, who was arrested by police and allegedly tortured in custody. 
The crime branch team led by IG Sreejith, investigating the alleged custodial torture of a young man in Varapuzha, announced the suspension of four police officers pending inquiry for their role in the man’s arrest. North Paravur CI Crispin Sam, Varapuzha sub-inspector Deepak, Grade ASI Sudheer and Sr. CPO Santhosh Baby were the officers suspended on Thursday. Earlier, three other junior cops had also been suspended. 
Sreejith, also the name of the 28-year-old man from Varapuzha who was picked up by police on the night of April 6 for his alleged role in a mob attack on a house, died on the evening of April 9 at a private hospital as a result of injuries allegedly sustained during police torture in custody. His family had told the Indian Express that Sreejith was severely beaten and kicked by police officials and denied timely medical treatment. They also claimed that he was innocent in the case and that the police had arrested the wrong ‘Sreejith’, not the man who was originally named in the complainant’s statement. 
“I saw him writhing in pain, holding his stomach. I wanted to give him some water, but the Sub-Inspector Deepak shouted at us. He told us to go away. I could see my son calling out to me for some water, but the police treated us so badly,” Sreejith’s mother, Shyamala said. 
Today, in a fresh twist to the case , a youth, whose father had given a police statement affirming that he saw Sreejith as part of the mob on April 6, told reporters that his father was coerced to change his statement on the directions of local CPM leaders. Sarath, the young man, told the media that his father had initially said he was not an eyewitness to the attack but later changed the statement after being influenced by the local CPM unit. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also asserted that his government will not protect those involved in custodial torture. “A high-level investigation has been initiated and therefore there is no need for any attempt to malign the government,” he said on Thursday. 
Varapuzha, a small town on the fringes of Kochi in central Kerala, has been boiling with protests by locals and political outfits demanding strong action and punishment against the police officers involved in Sreejith’s alleged custody murder.

കാസര്കോട്: (www.kasargodvartha.com 12.04.2018) വൈദ്യുതി ഉപയോഗം കുറയ്ക്കാന് കഴിയുന്നതിലൂടെ ആഗോള താപനംപോലുള്ള വിപത്തുകളെ നേരിടാനും നമ്മുക്ക് കഴിയുമെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയന് പറഞ്ഞു. ഒരു യൂണിറ്റ് വൈദ്യുതി ലാഭിക്കാന് കഴിഞ്ഞാല് വൈദ്യുതി ഉല്പാദിപ്പിക്കുന്നതിനായി വരുന്ന ഒരു കിലോഗ്രാം കല്ക്കരി ഉപയോഗിക്കാതിരിക്കാന് കഴിയും. ഇതിലൂടെ ആഗോള താപനത്തെയും നേരിടാന് കഴിയും. വൈദ്യുതി ഉല്പാദിപ്പിക്കുന്നതിനായി ഉപയോഗിക്കുന്ന കല്ക്കരി, പെട്രോളിയം തുടങ്ങിയ ഇന്ധനങ്ങള് കത്തിക്കുന്നതിലൂടെ അന്തരീക്ഷ മലിനീകരണത്തിനും ആഗോള താപനം പോലെയുള്ള കാലാവസ്ഥ വ്യതിയാനത്തിനും കാരണമാകുന്നുണ്ട്. ഇക്കാര്യത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് നമ്മുടെ ജനങ്ങളില് പലര്ക്കും ധാരാണയില്ലെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു.

കാസര്കോട് ജില്ലയിലെ പിലിക്കോടിനെ രാജ്യത്തെ ആദ്യത്തെ ഫിലമെന്റ് ബള്ബ് രഹിത പഞ്ചായത്തായി പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് സംസാരിക്കുകയായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം. പിലിക്കോട് നടപ്പിലാക്കിയത് സംസ്ഥാനത്താകെ നടപ്പിലാക്കുവാന് കഴിയുമോയെന്ന് നേരത്തെതന്നെ സര്ക്കാരിന്റെ ആലോചനയില് ഉണ്ടായിരുന്ന കാര്യമാണ്. സോളാറില് നിന്ന് വ്യാപകമായി വൈദ്യുതി ഉല്പാദിപ്പിക്കാന് കഴിയുന്നതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ആലോചിക്കാവുന്നതാണ്. സോളാര് പാനലുകള് സ്ഥാപിക്കാന് കഴിയുന്ന തരത്തിലുള്ള വീടുകളും കെട്ടിടങ്ങളും നമ്മുക്ക് ധാരാളമുണ്ട്. സംസ്ഥാനത്തിന് ആവശ്യമുള്ള വൈദ്യുതിയുടെ 70 ശതമാനവും പുറത്തുനിന്നാണ് നമ്മള് വാങ്ങുന്നത്.

30 ശതമാണ് ഇവിടെ ഉല്പാദിപ്പിക്കുന്നത്. അതില് ഏറിയ പങ്കും ജലവൈദ്യുത പദ്ധതികളില് നിന്നാണ്. മഴയുടെ ലഭ്യതയ്ക്കനുസരിച്ച് ഇതില് ഏറ്റക്കുറച്ചിലുണ്ടാകും. ഈ സാഹചര്യത്തില് വൈദ്യുതി ഉപയോഗം കുറച്ചുകൊണ്ടും സോളാര് പോലെയുള്ള വൈദ്യുത ഉല്പാദനത്തില് ശ്രദ്ധ കേന്ദ്രീകരിക്കാം. വൈദ്യുതി മേഖലയുടെ വികസനത്തിന് വലിയ പ്രാധാന്യമാണ് സര്ക്കാര് നല്കുന്നത്. കേരളത്തിന്റെ പൊതുവികസനത്തില് ശ്രദ്ധ കേന്ദ്രീകരിച്ച് രാജ്യത്തിനാകെ മാതൃകയാകുന്ന തരത്തില് എല്ലാവരുടെയും സഹകരണത്തോടെ വൈദ്യുതി ബോര്ഡിനെ വികസിപ്പിക്കുമെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു.

The church will distribute 100 boats, 1500 educational kits and scholarship to the victims' families and children over the next two years in the affected areas of Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha and Kollam. The program will benefit more than 1000 families of this region.
The launch was announced in presence of Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister, Kerala, P. J. Kurien, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Thiruvananthapuram along with Rev Dr. K. P. Yohannan, Metropolitan, Believers Eastern Church.
Other eminent dignitaries like Mathew T Thomas, the Minister for Water Resource's, Govt. of Kerala; Mayor of Trivandrum, MLA of Thiruvananthapuram East were present.
""Whereas the government is always doing its bit to help victims of such natural catastrophes, it is important that the civil society participants also contribute towards relief and rehabilitation measures. Our government appreciates and welcomes such initiatives and will extend all possible support for the successful roll-out and implementation of this project,"" said Chief Minister Vijayan.
Cyclone Ochki had ravaged a large part of coastal Kerala late last year killing a large number of people besides leading to loss of property and means of livelihood for locals. Most of the affected families were of fishermen who not only lost their property and belongings to the cyclone, but also lost their only means of livelihood - their fishing boats. Through this programme Believers Eastern Church aims to reach out to and rehabilitate fishermen community and their families.
""When I visited the site sometime back I realised that merely by giving clothes or food we would not be able to address the problem. Livelihood and education are the two most critical pillars of any social order. Over the next two years we will address these aspects and reach out to more such victims who need a little helping hand,"" said Yohannan.
Church's numerous other programmes have benefitted thousands of children, women, leprosy patients and victims of natural catastrophes by providing them education, counselling, health camps, medicines, hospitals, shelter, rehabilitation and clean drinking water. (NewsVoir)",english

For several years, the States of the Indian Union have relied heavily on the revenue accrued from sales tax to finance their infrastructure, economic and social development projects. Considered to be a ‘kamadhenu’ tax, unlike other taxes, it was an elastic source of revenue for States whose rates they could also tweak according to their requirements. Now that the Central government has introduced the GST with the objective of ensuring uniformity throughout the country, States have lost this elastic source of revenue. Income from other taxes is quite disproportionate. Though the Centre has promised to compensate States for losses suffered, the fact is that States are largely dependent on the Centre when it comes to development. This can be especially tough on those States which do not have an adequate resource base or the capacity to generate adequate revenue. Given that one of the greater responsibilities for States is in ensuring human development, in terms of education and health, the arguments put forth by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for a fair and just allocation of resources by the Finance Commission appear to be reasonable (Editorial page, “Heed the federal framework”, April 12). But will the Commission listen? 
A. Michael Dhanaraj, 
Coimbatore 
Apprehensions about the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, of fairness and equity in the distribution of public resources for development, are not unfounded. With the Centre doing away with plan and non-plan expenditure and States facing a double whammy (demonetisation and GST), it is imperative for the Finance Commission to facilitate diversity and follow a democratic path of development. The proposal of “measurable performance-based incentives” for States on the pretext of enhancing “fiscal discipline” is against the spirit of federalism. It can also jeopardise several initiatives of State governments by labelling them “populist”. It is time the BJP government negotiated with the Chief Ministers concerned to find a reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to their differences.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has demanded a judicial inquiry into the alleged custodial death of Sreejith, a native of Devaswompadam in Varappuzha. 
Speaking to the media after visiting Sreejith’s residence on Thursday, Mr. Chennithala said the government had not taken any action against the Varappuzha sub-inspector, against whom allegations were raised from various quarters, and added that the officers who were involved in the incident should be removed from service. 
“The police officers have violated all guidelines while arresting Sreejith. The statements of his mother and wife suggest that a few persons wearing saffron dhoti and shirt had taken him from his house. 
As per rules, if a person is taken into custody at night, a medical check-up should be conducted on him. The rule was flouted in this case,” he noted.

The highest incidence of infectious diseases during the last one decade was reported in 2017. The incidence of dengue rose from 7218 in 2016 to 19994 in 2017, deaths from 21 to 37. Cases of malaria stood at 987 with three deaths and diphtheria cases 70 with three deaths.
The prevalence of infectious diseases was widespread in corporation areas especially the big corporations. Compared to rural areas, the implementation of disease prevention and control programme in urban was poor. ""Shortage of staff deployed for preventive activities, lack of medical officers for supervision and entrusting additional responsibilities are some of the reasons for this state of affairs,"" said Dr Raoof K.A.
According to him the rural areas had so far been able to effectively implement the preventive programmes. However, the flawed implementation of government's flagship programme Ardram Mission had derailed these activities in rural areas. The mission's objectives are well stated; building effective resistance to infectious diseases, training doctors and nursing staff, focusing on life style diseases, respiratory tract problems, depression, maternal care, special clinics and preventive actives.
Instead of working for achieving these objectives, the health department was going ahead with a single point agenda of extending OP timings in primary and family health centres. These factors have almost derailed the disease control activities. The pre-monsoon disease prevention and control activities are carried out in April every year. However, it is yet to begin though a high level meeting was held here on Wednesday under chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister K.K. Shylaja.
The KGMOA said only blue paint and airport chairs should not be the trade mark of family health centres. If a family health centre is to function efficiently between 9 am to 2 pm, it would require a minimum of three doctors. But extending its time till 6 pm with same staff strength will end up adversely affecting disease control and prevention programmes.
Dr Raoof said though the KGMOA had brought these issues before the health minister and top health authorities, there has been no change on the ground. The association has now demanded chief minister's intervention in bringing Ardram Mission back on track and ensuring the effective implementation of preventive measures.",english

Appropriate further action will be taken on the findings of the inquiry, he said in Kasargod.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded an inquiry into the entire issue by a sitting district judge. Human Rights Commission has asked the government to fix responsibility of higher police officers as well. Apart from registration of criminal cases, the cops involved in the incident should be removed from service.
The custodial death has exposed the failure of the home department and police top brass in reining in rogue cops within in the force. Even the repeated warnings issued by the chief minister to police personnel against taking law into their hands, seems to have had little impact.

With the court's order, Bishop K P Yohannan's Believers Church has got the ownership right of the land in Cheruvally Estate , which was proposed as the site for the project. Around 800 acres of the total 2,263 acres in the estate was needed for the project. Now, the government will have to acquire the land from Believers Church .
According to Kottayam District Congress Committee secretary Rony K Baby, ""With the government losing the Harrisons case, it will be forced to accept the terms and conditions to be set by the Church for acquiring the land.""
Baby alleged a conspiracy behind the government losing the case against Harrisons. ""The government lost the case to protect the interest of Believers Church . While the government had all the chances to win, it deliberately lost the case to acquire the land from the Church, offering them 25 per cent share in the airport project. As a result, the government also regularised the possession of the rest of the land to the company,"" he said. The government's efforts over the past 20 years to take over around 5 lakh acres of land, which is under the illegal possession of various companies, has been completely sabotaged with the latest High Court order, he said.
Baby alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was directly involved in sabotaging the case in court. ""When the UDF was in power, the law secretary had recommended the government to take over the illegal possessions from companies on the basis of the Rajamanickam report. However, the law secretary changed the stance two-a-and-half years later, recommending not to accept the report, which became favourable for the companies in court,"" he alleged.
He urged government to introduce a new law in line with the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, to tide over the current crisis.Meanwhile, Believers Church public relations officer Fr Sijo Panthapallil
said the Church won't object if the government approaches it with the project. ""We have not received any official communication from the government regarding the Erumeli airport project. The terms and conditions will be discussed only after that. The Church council will discuss such things after hearing the government's proposal and take a decision on it,"" he said.

The action came on a day when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government will take stringent action in custodial deaths and those responsible will not be spared. With this, the number of police personnel suspended in connection with the death has risen to seven. Earlier, three police personnel of the armed police camp at Kalamassery in Kochi were suspended on April 10, a day after S R Sreejith died at a hospital. The decision to suspend the four was taken based on a preliminary report by a special investigation team set up to probe the allegations that the youth from Varappuzha died due to police torture, a senior police official said. Those suspended are North Paravoor Circle Inspector Chrispin Sam, Sub-Inspector Deepak, Grade Assistant Sub-Inspector Sudheer and civic police officer Santhosh Baby, all attached to Varappuzha police station. Police in Thiruvananthapuram said a direction had been given to instal CCTV cameras in all 470 police stations in the station. A report from Kochi, quoting police, said a department-level probe had also been launched against the suspended policemen. Earlier today, the SIT chief IGP S Sreejit visited the house of the deceased and took statements of his wife, parents and others and submitted his preliminary report to the DGP. In his first reaction to the incident, Vijayan speaking in Kasaragod said: ""In custodial deaths, the government will ensure strict action."" The accused, whoever they may be, will not be allowed to escape, Vijayan said adding the LDF government would ensure that they face action. Sreejit had died in a hospital with his family alleging that the youth was kicked several times on the stomach and thrashed by the police officials who took him into custody in connection with a case relating to suicide of a 52-year-old CPI(M) sympathiser. ""Those taken into custody should not die. The government's stand is those responsible for such deaths will not be spared. In Sreejith's case a proper investigation is now going on', Vijayan, who holds the home portfolio, said. The Opposition Congress sought a court monitored probe into the incident while BJP has demanded that Vijayan give up the home portfolio. Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala alleged that lockups in the state had become 'killing fields'. BJP President Kummanam Rajasekharan demanded a CBI probe into the custodial death of Sreejit. The party would launch an agitation demanding a compensation of Rs.25 lakhs to the family of Sreejit and also a job to his wife, he said. As the first phase of the stir, BJP General Secretary A N Radhakrishnan would observe a 24-hour fast in front of the Range IG Office at Kochi on April 23, he added.

Even as the Kerala Government is trying to take full control of all Hindu temples in the State and bring them under the direct management of the CPI (M), the Kerala High Court on Monday delivered a lethal blow to the State Government as well as the CPI(M). 
When the Court asked the Government of Kerala how the appointments to the Devaswam Boards were being made, the government did not have a proper and convincing reply which spilled the beans 
A bench of Justices P R Ramachandra Menon and Devan Ramachandran said in a landmark judgment on Monday that the appointments to Devaswam Boards in Kerala, which control, administer and rule the temples, are riddled with secrecy and the Government has to change it with immediate effect . 
T G Mohan Das, Kerala president, Virat Hindustan Sangam, who is also the petitioner, in this case, told Team PGurus that if the Government implements the recommendations of the High Court, it is sure that the temples would come out of Government control. Das, described as a one-man army waging an intellectual, cultural and political battle against the Lefts and other religious fundamentalists in the State has been waging this legal battle since 2015. 
When the Court asked the Government of Kerala how the appointments to the Devaswam Boards were being made, the government did not have a proper and convincing reply which spilled the beans. It may be noted that T Rajesh, a CPI(M) MLA, and a known Hindu baiter had introduced a private member’s bill in the legislative assembly to take over the entire Hindu temples in the State. 
Temples in Kerala have been the Kamadhenus or Holy Cows of political parties in the State. Though the Devaswam Boards in the State which administer the temples should have believers as their members the Communists pack them with their own nominees, mostly non-believers. Recently, the Travancore Devaswam Board wound up a vegetarian canteen in the premises of Raja Rajeswari Temple at Thiruvananthapuram and launched an exclusive non-vegetarian restaurant selling beef. The TDB is headed by Padmakumar, an acolyte of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. 
Lord Ayyappa Temple at Sabarimala is administered by TDB . But the temple or the Devaswam Board do not maintain a book of account and the public is in the dark about the goings-on in the temple and on the board. The post of a peon in TDB commands a premium of Rs 5,00,000 . It is an open secret that the post of the chief priest of Sabarimala is auctioned to the highest bidder . Along with the TDB, the members of the Thazhaman Family, the traditional priests (Thanthri) of the temple are having a free run in the affairs of the temple. Mohanaru, the elder son of the Thanthri, was caught red-handed while he was performing “Pooja” with a notorious woman in an Ernakulam apartment . 
The appointment of the chief priest of Sabarimala Temple is for one year and the going rate for the post varies between Rs 50 lakhs to Rs one crore, according to a seasoned priest in Ernakulam. “I applied a couple of times but the amount they ask for is beyond my capacity,” said the Namboodiri who belongs to a well known Illam in Kerala., 
Justice R Mahadevan of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court accepted the contention of a devotee who proved with statistics and details extracted through Right to Information Act 
The Kerala Government has made it mandatory for the TDB to deposit a major chunk of the annual income of Sabarimala Temple in the Government account in the state treasury and nationalized banks. No question is asked about how the money is spent by the government though there are reports that the money is transferred to some of the church and mosque accounts . 
The copy of Monday’s judgment is yet to be uploaded in the Kerala High Court website due to server error. As and when the verdict copy is uploaded we will bring it to the notice of respected readers. 
It may be remembered that Madras High Court in a recent order has asked the Tamil Nadu Government to furnish the details of 50,000 acres of prime land which disappeared from the temple properties which come under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department. 
Justice R Mahadevan of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court accepted the contention of a devotee who proved with statistics and details extracted through Right to Information Act that 40 years ago, temples and related religious institutions in the State-owned 5.25 lakh acres of agricultural land which has come down to 4.78 lakh acres by 2017. 
The justice ordered the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to initiate urgent measures to retrieve the 50,000 acres of prime property and report back to the Court about the action taken. Temple worshippers allege that the Dravidian governments which ruled the State during the last five decades disposed off these prime lands to their relations and associates and for gratification . 
If these verdicts are read together with the Supreme Court verdict on the Chidambaram Temple administration in Tamil Nadu, the day is not far off when all temples in the country would be freed from the shackles of the governments. ",english

In March, K Chandrasekhar Rao dramatically unveiled his plan to float a Third Front, a coalition of regional satraps. He gave expression to resentment among states that too many powers are vested in the Centre, giving them little elbow room. The Telangana chief minister was peeved with having to constantly request Delhi for funds for different projects, making it a very unequal relationship. KCR was batting for a new form of cooperative federalism which envisages limited powers to the Centre and maximum powers to the states. File image of Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao. AFP 
KCR followed it up with a high-profile visit to Kolkata to meet Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. His decision to send his relative Santhosh Kumar to the Rajya Sabha was also seen as ensuring a trusted aide will be his point person in New Delhi, to facilitate his national ambitions. 
Which is why KCR's decision not to send his finance minister to Thiruvananthapuram to attend a conclave of southern finance ministers on Tuesday has raised eyebrows. The meeting came on the back of Siddaramaiah, Chandrababu Naidu, Pinarayi Vijayan and DMK leader MK Stalin expressing their displeasure at the Terms of Reference of the 15th Finance Commission. Their argument was that the southern states would be penalised for doing better on the population control front, as the 2011 population census will reflect. The meeting was attended by economists as well to give it the veneer of a non-political conclave. 
States such as Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra feel more funds are devolved to the northern states at the cost of those in the Peninsula. Between 1971 and 2011, while the population in south India went up 85 percent, the BIMARU states in north India (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh) went up by 144 percent. This will affect how funds are allocated if only the 2011 census is taken into account. Already in terms of every rupee it gave to the Centre between 2014-17, the south got back 52 paise while the north Indian states got Rs 3.25 
Telangana was not the only one to stay away. Tamil Nadu finance minister O Panneerselvam too gave the meeting a miss. This was deeply ironic because according to Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, if the 2011 population census is used as a reference, his state will lose Rs 20,000 crore between 2020-21 and 2024-25 while Tamil Nadu will lose Rs 40,000 crore. 
KCR's decision to stay away was both political and strategic. According to a back of the envelope calculation by the Telangana finance ministry, the state expects to gain marginally even if the 2011 census is taken into account because of other parameters that will come into play. So the government found no rationale for Telangana to join the pressure group. 
""The chief minister feels that there are multiple fora and opportunities for the state to voice its concerns and there is no need to do it at the conclave of south finance ministers"", a senior bureaucrat in the finance ministry said. ""One such meeting was held by the 15th Finance commission in Hyderabad on 9 February, where we put forth our concerns"". 
Sources say, more importantly, KCR was not convinced this was a North-South issue as the conclave sought to project. The apprehension was that this was turning into an anti-BJP club, more political than pure economics. KCR's domestic concern is also that this south India pressure group will strengthen the Congress hand given that both Karnataka and Puducherry are ruled by the party. That won't be good news for KCR since his principal rival in Telangana is the Congress. 
Speaking in the Telangana Assembly earlier this month, KCR had spoken out against the North-South rhetoric: ""Some states are talking about North-South divide and the Centre showing discrimination towards southern states. I do not encourage such things. This is not good for the nation or national integration or national interest. The Centre should take measures to prevent these kind of situations in the future"". 
Even though Telangana has other concerns, it is significant that it chose not to rub shoulders with its neighbours to make its point. A finance ministry official points out that external borrowings now come with too many conditionalities imposed by the Centre. Telangana feels the decision on how the money should be spent should be left to the democratically elected state government instead of New Delhi dictating terms. 
KCR's decision has left a lot many confused. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi's decision to keep up the protests in Lok Sabha, along with the AIADMK, thereby ensuring the speaker could not take up the no-trust vote moved by the YSR Congress and the Telugu Desam, raised suspicions about their intent. It was felt that their deed was in effect, bailing out the BJP government. 
With regional parties looking to ensure unity to take on the BJP, KCR's moves in the past two weeks will only increase the trust deficit. For someone who aimed to lead the Federal Front, that will not be good news.

Four more police personnel were suspended today in connection with the alleged custodial death of 26-year old man near Kochi, over which opposition parties have been attacking the LDF government. 
The action came on a day when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government will take stringent action in custodial deaths and thoseresponsible will not be spared. 
With this, the number of police personnel suspended in connection with the death has risen to seven. Earlier, three police personnel of the armed police camp at Kalamassery in Kochi were suspended on April 10, a day after S R Sreejith died at a hospital. 
The decision to suspend the four was taken based on a preliminary report by a special investigation team set up to probe the allegations that the youth from Varappuzha died due to police torture, a senior police official said. 
Those suspended are North Paravoor Circle Inspector Chrispin Sam, Sub-Inspector Deepak, Grade Assistant Sub-Inspector Sudheer and civic police officer Santhosh Baby, all attached to Varappuzha police station. 
Police in Thiruvananthapuram said a direction had been given to instal CCTV cameras in all 470 police stations in the station. 
A report from Kochi, quoting police, said a department-level probe had also been launched against the suspended policemen. 
Earlier today, the SIT chief IGP S Sreejit visited the house of the deceased and took statements of his wife, parents and others and submitted his preliminary report to the DGP. 
In his first reaction to the incident, Vijayan speaking in Kasaragod said: ""In custodial deaths, the government will ensure strict action."" The accused, whoever they may be, will not be allowed to escape, Vijayan said adding the LDF government would ensure that they face action. 
Sreejit had died in a hospital with his family alleging that the youth was kicked several times on the stomach and thrashed by the police officials who took him into custody in connection with a case relating to suicide of a 52-year-old CPI(M) sympathiser. 
""Those taken into custody should not die. The government's stand is those responsible for such deaths will not be spared. In Sreejith's case a proper investigation is now going on', Vijayan, who holds the home portfolio, said. 
The Opposition Congress sought a court monitored probe into the incident while BJP has demanded that Vijayan give up the home portfolio. 
Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala alleged that lockups in the state had become 'killing fields'. 
BJP President Kummanam Rajasekharan demanded a CBI probe into the custodial death of Sreejit. 
The party would launch an agitation demanding a compensation of Rs.25 lakhs to the family of Sreejit and also a job to his wife, he said. 
As the first phase of the stir, BJP General Secretary A N Radhakrishnan would observe a 24-hour fast in front of the Range IG Office at Kochi on April 23, he added. 
BJP had earlier observed a hartal in Varappuzha Panchayat, protesting the death of Sreejith, who it claimed was its worker. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.) First Published: Thu, April 12 2018. 21:50 IST ",english

Facing flak over the case of a 26-year-old man who died after allegedly being tortured by the police, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan today said his government would take stringent action in custodial deaths and culprits would not be spared. 
The LDF government in the state would ensure that those responsible faced action, he asserted. 
""In custodial deaths, the government will ensure strict action,"" he said at a function here referring to the death of S R Sreejit at Varappuzha near Kochi on April 9. 
The accused, whoever they may be, will not be allowed to escape, Vijayan said. 
The family of Sreejit, who died in a hospital, had alleged that he was kicked several times on the stomach and thrashed by police officials who took him into custody in connection with a case relating to the suicide of a 52-year-old CPI(M) sympathiser. 
While the police have rejected the allegations of torture, three police personnel were suspended in connection with the death and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the case. 
""Those taken into custody should not die. The government's stand is those responsible for such deaths will not be spared,"" the chief minister said. 
""In Sreejit's case, a proper investigation is now going on,"" Vijayan, who holds the home portfolio, added. 
On the basis of the probe team's report, the government would take action, he said.

Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala today alleged that lock-ups in Kerala have become ""killing fields"" under CPI(M) rule and sought a judicial probe into the death of a 26-year-old man in police custody in Varappuzha near here. 
Chennithala also alleged that Pinarayi Vijayan-led government was 'hesitant' to take action against the Sub-Inspector of Varappuzha police station despite widespread condemnation from various quarters against 'police brutality' towards Sreejith and his brother. 
""Lock-ups in Kerala have become killing fields. Sreejith and his brother were subjected to brutal torture in police custody,"" Chennithala told reporters after meeting Sreejith's family in Varappuzha. 
The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly said Sreejith is the sixth victim of custodial torture after the CPI(M)-led LDF came to power in the state. 
All those policemen who were responsible for the death of Sreejith should be removed from service and should be tried for murder, Chennithala said. 
Seeking a probe by a district judge into the incident, Chennithala criticised the silence of the Chief Minister on the matter. 
Due procedures were not followed by the police for taking Sreejith and his brother into custody, he claimed. 
Three policemen were suspended on Tuesday in connection with the death of Sreejith in police custody, while a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the case. 
Sreejith, who was taken into custody in connection with the death of a person last week, died in a private hospital on Monday evening. 
His relatives alleged that he died due to torture. 
Police have rejected the allegation of torture, saying Sreejith was suspected to have suffered injuries during a clash allegedly before he was taken into custody. 
DGP Loknath Behera has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the case following allegations that police harassment and torture caused death of Sreejith. 
BJP had observed a dawn-to-dusk hartal on Tuesday in Varappuzha Panchayat, protesting the death of Sreejith, who they claimed was a party worker.

After its successful drive for organic vegetables and palliative care, the ruling CPI(M) in Kerala is foraying into yet another campaign, this time against liquor and intoxicating drugs. 
The left party is opening a new de-addiction and counselling centre in its stronghold Kannur, the politically volatile northern district, as part of its large-scale goal to cement its grassroot level support. 
The Centre is envisaged as a platform to help people recover from the addiction to abusive substances through scientific treatment and counselling. 
The opening of the party-sponsored de-addiction centre assumes significance in the wake of the LDF government drawing flak over its new liquor policy which facilitated reopening of some of the closed bars by the previous UDF government. 
The declared liquor policy of the LDF is abstinence while the Congress-led UDF advocates total prohibition in a phased manner. 
Located at Thazhe Chovva in the district, the Centre is coming under the aegis of the party-led 'Initiative of Rehabilitation and Palliative Care (IRPC).' Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would inaugurate the centre at a function tomorrow, CPI(M) Kannur district Secretary P Jayarajan said. 
Detailing the significance of the move, he said the abuse of contraband substance is on the rise causing alarm. 
""Various kinds of new intoxicating substances are flooding the market attracting teenagers and youths. So, it is the need of the hour to check this social evil, from destroying our individuals, families and society, through people's movement,"" Jayarajan said in a Facebook post. 
The party strongman said the IRPC has already been indulging in several awareness programmes against drug abuse and the new centre is an extension of the initiative. 
With an aim to reach out to common people and strengthen its grassroot level base, the ruling CPI(M) has launched several initiatives ranging from organic vegetable cultivation to palliative care. 
The state-wide drive promoting organic vegetables under the title 'Jaiva Jeevitham' had been a huge success. 
The left party is also planning to open 1000 outlets of organic vegetables across the state during the coming 'Vishu' festival season. 
The party volunteers have also built houses for poor, cleaned polluted water bodies and taken up waste management drives in various parts of the state to reach out to the masses.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday demanded the reframing of the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission which, he said, was necessary to save the federal structure of the Indian Union. 
The Finance Commission -- which delves into the financial relations between the Centre and states -- should be guided more by its constitutional mandate than arbitrary terms of reference, Vijayan said in his inaugural address at the one-day workshop here. 
The workshop was called by state Finance Minister Thomas Issac for his counterparts from southern states to express resentment against the Centre and to have a detailed review and critique of the terms of reference of the Finance Commission. 
Finance Minister of Tamil Nadu and Telengana were conspicuous by their absence at the event. 
""... (there is) a conspicuous bias in-built in the terms of reference of the new commission. It is widely feared that these terms framed by the Centre will prevent the panel from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility,"" Vijayan added. 
The Chief Minister said all states should appeal to the central government to reframe the terms of reference. 
""The reframing of the terms of reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country and to reinforce its unity and integrity,"" said Vijayan, a senior Communist Party of India-Marxist leader from Kerala. 
Vijayan said the commission role assumes significance, given the fact that the Centre is given near monopoly over the right to mobilise resources. 
""We are all aware that the terms of reference have created apprehension about the principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in devolution of financial powers and resources to the states by the Centre,"" the Chief Minister added. 
Vijayan expressed reservation over the Financial Commission proposal for ""measurable performance-based-incentives"" which he claimed was an attack on the federal structure of the Indian state. 
""Such terms of reference, we fear, might end up altering the commission's status from a constitutional authority entrusted with devolution of national fiscal resources to an administrative mechanism for fiscal administration and monitoring,"" added Vijayan.

ഹൃദയം നുറുങ്ങുന്ന വേദനയോടെ മാത്രമേ കാശ്മീരിലെ പിഞ്ചു ബാലികയെ കുറിച്ചുള്ള വാർത്ത കേൾക്കാൻ കഴിയൂ. മകളേ മാപ്പ് 
മനസ്സിൽ നിറയെ വർണ്ണങ്ങളും, മുഖത്ത് പുഞ്ചിരിയും, കുസൃതികളുമായി കളിച്ചു നടക്കേണ്ട പ്രായത്തിലാണ് ഒരു കുഞ്ഞിനും വരരുതെന്ന് നാം പ്രാർത്ഥിക്കുന്ന അവസ്ഥ ഈ ബാലികക്ക് വന്നു ചേർന്നത്. മതത്തിന്റെ പേരിൽ ഒരു കൂട്ടം അക്രമികൾ ചെയ്തു കൂട്ടിയത് മതേതര ജനാധിപത്യ ഇന്ത്യയിലെ എക്കാലത്തെയും കറുത്ത അധ്യായമാണ്. എത്ര വലിയ ശത്രുത സൂക്ഷിച്ചിരുന്നാലും നിഷ്കളങ്കത മാറാത്ത ഒരു എട്ടു വയസുകാരിയെ ദിവസങ്ങളോളം ഭക്ഷണം പോലും നൽകാതെ ഇത്തരത്തിൽ കൊടും ക്രൂരതയ്ക്ക് വിധേയമാക്കി മാനഭംഗപ്പെടുത്തി കൊലപ്പെടുത്തുന്നത് മൃഗീയം എന്ന് വിശേഷിപ്പിച്ചാൽ കുറഞ്ഞു പോകും. മൃഗങ്ങൾ പോലും കാടിന്റെ നിയമമനുസരിച്ചേ ജീവിക്കാറുള്ളു, ഇത്തരം നിഷ്ട്ടൂരതയെ വിശേഷിപ്പിക്കാൻ ഇനിയും വാക്കുകൾ കണ്ടെത്തേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. മുദ്രാവാക്യം വിളിച്ചത് കൊണ്ടായില്ല 
""ബേട്ടി ബച്ചാവോ, ബേട്ടി പഠാവോ” എന്ന് നാട് മുഴുവൻ ചുമരുകളിൽ എഴുതി വച്ചതുകൊണ്ടോ, റേഡിയോവിൽ മൻ കി ബാത്തിലൂടെ വിളിച്ചു പറഞ്ഞത് കൊണ്ടോ ആയില്ല പ്രിയ പ്രധാനമന്ത്രി, താങ്കൾക്ക് മുദ്രാവാക്യം വിളിക്കുന്നവരാൽ ഒരു പാവം പെൺകുട്ടിയുടെയും അവളുടെ കുടുംബത്തിന്റെയും ജീവിതത്തിലെ വെളിച്ചം എന്നെന്നേക്കുമായി തല്ലി കെടുത്തിയ താങ്കളുടെ അനുയായികളെപ്പോലുള്ളവരെ മനുഷ്യരാക്കി മാറ്റുന്നതിനാണ് താങ്കൾ ആദ്യം ശ്രദ്ധ ചെലുത്തേണ്ടത്. പ്രതിപക്ഷ പാർട്ടികൾക്കെതിരെ താങ്കളുടെ ഉപവാസ സമരം നടക്കുമ്പോഴാണ് ഈ വാർത്തകൾ വന്നു തുടങ്ങുന്നത്. അതിനു ശേഷം മണിക്കൂറുകൾ പിന്നിട്ടിട്ടും താങ്കൾ പാലിക്കുന്ന മൗനമാണ് ലോകത്തിലെ ഏറ്റവും വലിയ ജനാധിപത്യ രാജ്യത്തോടുള്ള വെല്ലുവിളി. സംഘപരിവാരുകാർ ഭീഷണി 
യൂറോപ്പിലോ അമേരിക്കയിലോ ഉള്ള താങ്കളുടെ സുഹൃത്തുക്കൾക്ക് പിറന്നാൾ ആശംസിക്കുമ്പോഴല്ല സ്വന്തം രാജ്യത്തെ ജനങ്ങളുടെ ദുഃഖത്തിൽ പങ്കു ചേരുമ്പോൾ, അവരെ ആശ്വസിപ്പിക്കുമ്പോൾ ആണ് താങ്കൾ ഒരു മനുഷ്യത്വമുള്ള നേതാവാകൂ. വൈകിയാണെങ്കിലും ഈ നാടൊന്നാകെ ആ കുടുംബത്തിന്റെ ദുഃഖത്തിൽ പങ്കുചേരുമ്പോൾ ഈ കിരാത കൃത്യത്തെ ന്യായീകരിക്കാൻ അങ്ങയെ അനുകൂലിക്കുന്നവർ സോഷ്യൽ മീഡിയയിൽ കാണിച്ചു കൂട്ടുന്ന ചെയ്തികൾ കാണുമ്പോൾ മനസിലാവും സംഘ പരിവാറുകാർ എത്രമേൽ ഭീഷണിയാണ് ഈ നാടിൻറെ ഐക്യം തകർക്കുവാനും, മത മൈത്രി കളങ്കപ്പെടുത്തുന്നതിലും എന്ന്. മകളേ, നീ അനുഭവിച്ച കഷ്ടതയും, വേദനയും ഇനിയുമൊരു കുട്ടിയുടെയും ജീവിതത്തിലേക്ക് കടന്നു ചെല്ലാതിരിക്കട്ടേ എന്ന പ്രാർത്ഥനയോടെ അന്ത്യാഞ്ജലി. ഫേസ്ബുക്ക് പോസ്റ്റ്

Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 13 (IANS): The Malayalam film industry on Friday walked away with a bag full of awards at the 65th National Film Awards in categories like best director, supporting actor, cinematography, socially relevant film, screenplay and a special mention. 
Six-time National Award winner Jayaraj, 57, won the best director award for his film ""Bhayanakam"", which also won the best cameraman award for Nikhil S. Praveen and also the best adapted screenplay. 
""I just cannot find words to describe my emotions and feelings at the moment after hearing the news. Not many know that about 650 people had gone to fight in the Second World War from Kuttanadu and the film tells the tale of that. 
""I dedicate this award to them,"" said Jayaraj, who won his second National Award for direction. 
""Thondimuthulem Driksashiyum"" was selected as the best regional film in Malayalam. 
Upcoming star Fahad Fazil, who was selected as the best supporting actor, said: ""I would rate this as the toughest character I have played and I am able to perform this well because I am in Malayalam films. 
""I never expected that I would get an award, but we all knew the film 'Thondimuthulem Driksashiyum' would bring in awards. But at the time my worry all the time was the commercial success, as that is very crucial for the industry.""

The government has nothing to hide.” Police on Friday picked up Sreejith, 26, from the coastal town of Varappuzha in the port city of Kochi on allegedly mistaken identity and he died in a hospital in Kochi two days later.It had shaken the government that rode to power on the promise better policing two years back after the rape and murder of Dalit woman by a migrant worker.Sreejith’s was reportedly the 16th death in police brutality since Vijayan assumed office.It was for the first time he reacted to the latest death after which the police chief, Loknath Behera, instituted a high-level investigation and suspended three cops.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Inspector General S Sreejith has in its initial report, suggested disciplinary action against four more cops including a circle inspector and a sub-inspector.Later in the evening they also got a suspension.The police had arrested ten men, including Sreejith, over the weekend accusing them of driving a 55-year-old man, Vasudevan, to suicide.Residents say the entire episode was a fallout of intense fight for supremacy between the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or the CPM and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trying hard to place itself as the “real opposition”.BJP leaders say Sreejith was an active worker though his mother denied it. Reports also suggested the interference of the local CPM leaders to plant “fake witnesses.” The BJP demanded the arrest of all the copes and announced a series of protests, beginning with a 24-hour fast on Monday. BJP general secretary AN Radhakrishnan said he would fast demanding the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take it over from the local police, a compensation of Rs 2.5 million to the family and a government job for his widow.",english

KANNUR: Ruling Communist Party of India — Marxist (CPIM), which invited the flak from women and the Church for liberalising liquor regime in the state, is planning an initiative in the opposite direction. The campaign is aimed at fighting the evils of rampant use of liquor and burgeoning drug menace in Kerala. The new de-addiction and counselling centres will be launched in Kannur in the beginning, to be set up in other districts later, according to party circles. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the first centre located at Thazhe Chovva near here at a function on Friday.The Centre, under the aegis of the party-led ‘Initiative of Rehabilitation and Palliative Care’ (IRPC), is envisaged as a platform to help people recover from the addiction to abusive substances through scientific treatment and counselling. Apart from counselling, treatment by expert doctors and nurses would be made available at these centres. “The rise in abuse of contraband substance is causing alarm. Various kinds of new intoxicating substances are flooding the market attracting teenagers and youths. So, it is the need of the hour to check this social evil, from destroying our individuals, families and society, through people’s m movement,” CPIM Kannur district secretary P Jayarajan said in a Facebook post. He said the IRPC has already been indulging in several awareness programmes against drug abuse and the new centre is an extension of the initiative.Huge quantities of banned drugs and narcotics were confiscated by authorities from various parts of the state, of late.CPIM had launched campaigns for popularising organic cultivation and also for stepping up palliative care initiative in the state. All these campaigns were well received by public despite political objectives underlying it. The state-wide drive promoting organic vegetables under the title ‘Jaiva Jeevitham’ had been a huge success.The new liquor policy of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government facilitated reopening of some of the closed bars by the previous UDF government. The declared liquor policy of the LDF is abstinence while the Congress-led UDF advocates total prohibition in a phased manner. CPIM is also planning to open 1000 outlets for vegetables across the state during the coming ‘Vishu’ festival season. In an effort to enlarge the popular base of the party especially in villages, CPIM volunteers have also built houses for poor.",english

His repeated requests to upgrade his school to a high school was turned down by the government.
Inaugurating the dharna, A P J M Sheik Dawood , grand nephew of former president A P J Abdul Kalam and trustee of Kalam Foundation , urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to upgrade the school to enable Asim continue his studies.
""Mohammed Asim's demand is a genuine one. If APJ Abdul Kalam was alive he would have intervened on the issue as he believed that every child in the country had the right for education,"" Dawood said.
Twelve-year old Asim, who was born without hands and has 90% disability, has completed his seventh standard from the Velimanna school which is just 250 metre away from his house.
Asim said that he will have to stop his studies if the UP school is not upgraded to a high school as travelling 6 km to the lone aided high school in the panchayat was difficult for him.
A large number of people from the village of Velimanna and Omassery panchayat, including students, took part in the dharna.
Later Asim and office bearers of the action committee that was formed to raise the issue met district collector UV Jose.
The district collector said that he would try his best to get the school upgraded.",english

The Malayalam film industry on Friday walked away with a bag full of awards at the 65th National Film Awards in categories like best director, supporting actor, cinematography, socially relevant film, screenplay and a special mention. 
Six-time National Award winner Jayaraj, 57, won the best director award for his film “Bhayanakam”, which also won the best cameraman award for Nikhil S. Praveen and also the best adapted screenplay. 
“I just cannot find words to describe my emotions and feelings at the moment after hearing the news. Not many know that about 650 people had gone to fight in the Second World War from Kuttanadu and the film tells the tale of that. 
“I dedicate this award to them,” said Jayaraj, who won his second National Award for direction. 
“Thondimuthulem Driksashiyum” was selected as the best regional film in Malayalam. 
Upcoming star Fahad Fazil, who was selected as the best supporting actor, said: “I would rate this as the toughest character I have played and I am able to perform this well because I am in Malayalam films. 
“I never expected that I would get an award, but we all knew the film ‘Thondimuthulem Driksashiyum’ would bring in awards. But at the time my worry all the time was the commercial success, as that is very crucial for the industry.” 
Journalist-turned-scriptwriter Sajeev Pazhoor walked away with the best scriptwriter award. 
Veteran playback singer K.J. Yesudas won his eighth national award for the best male playback singer for his song “Poyimarenja kalam”. 
“Take off” was another film that got due recognition when its lead actress Parvathy won a special mention besides Santhosh Raman who won the award for the best production design. 
“Right from the time the film was released, I used to get a huge response from all those who saw it. This was really motivating and many felt that this film would win awards and that has happened. The entire cast and crew of the film deserved it,” said Parvathy. 
The film shows the travails of Kerala nurses who were caught in ‘war affected’ West Asia and how they were repatriated. 
“Aalorukum” bagged the best film under the social issues category.

The State will go ahead with the ongoing land acquisition initiatives for the proposed national highway widening works notwithstanding the stiff resistance from some affected group, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. 
“Kerala is warranted to take up major developmental initiatives by acquiring the relatively scarce land. However, a few groups have come in the open to oppose such moves and the State will be driven to overcome such resistance for the sake of developmental aspirations,” Mr. Vijayan said while addressing a public function to inaugurate a newly constructed building of the Karadukka block panchayat at Karmamthodi here on Thursday. The Chief Minister’s observation came at a time when the State was witnessing stiff resistance to the moves to level-up marked stretches of wetland areas in the Keezhattur paddy field near Taliparamba in Kannur and select pockets in Malappuram where road realignments were. 
“It is a fact that many people are holding scarce land. In such a scenario, people will be forced to hand over their precious land for the sake of development while the State is determined to ensure maximum compensation for the land used for developmental needs,” he said. 
He lauded four individuals for gifting one acre of land to facilitate the building for the local body. The four individuals had set a role model for the entire State by offering land free of cost, the Chief Minister said. 
Liberal compensations 
Stating that the authorities concerned had managed to vest adequate land from the northern tip of Thalppadi to Kasaragod for the NH widening project, he said the Centre had expressed its willingness to make liberal compensations of up to ₹6 crore for one km of land for the NH project as against ₹65 lakh in other States, he said Union Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had adopted a favourable stance taking into account the ground realities in Kerala.",english

Leaders of the Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) have warned that they will intensify their agitation against the decision of the State government to start evening Out Patient (OP) clinics in community health centres and taluk and district hospitals without providing infrastructure and manpower facilities at these government-run health institutions. 
The doctors have already started an indefinite protest from Friday and they attended only emergency cases in casualty. They also stayed away from private practice. However, doctors in medical colleges are not participating in the strike. 
At a news conference here, KGMOA leaders said that they would face the action including the government’s threat to proceed with the Essential Services Maintenance (ESMA) Act against the striking doctors. From Saturday, the doctors would admit only critically-ill patients. If the government failed to come out with a concrete solution, the doctors would stop all services, KGOMA State president A.K. Rauf and general secretary V. Jithesh said. 
They also accused the Department of Health of being irresponsible and urged Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to intervene in the issue immediately. 
The KGMOA also asked the government to revoke the decision to place a doctor under suspension for boycotting work at Kumaramputhoor in Palakkad district who had protested against the move to start evening OP clinics in the State. The government was trying to divert the attention of the people from real issues, they said. 
Without adequate infrastructure facilities at the government-run hospitals, the KGMOA leaders said, the evening OP clinics would remain non-functional. Besides, the manpower was limited at many of the community health centres and taluk hospitals. Only a single doctor has to man a clinic in a State that has nearly 650 primary health centres. 
Converting primary health centres into community health centres with the staff appointed on temporary basis would be disastrous and would defeat the purpose of health care system, they said.",english

Every film industry needs to address casting couch issues,"Not just Tollywood. Every film industry needs to address casting couch issues Janani K READ LATER Sri Reddy 
2017 was the year of several movements that called out sexual harassment at the workplace. When Hollywood actresses exposed Harvey Weinstein and their experience with the casting couch, it sparked off the #MeToo movement which later snowballed and had thousands of women raising their voice against exploitation of women. 
Following the #MeToo movement, actresses in India, more importantly down South, have opened up about the casting couch. But still, there hasn't been any considerable improvement as far as women's security is concerned. 
The phrase 'casting couch' speaks volumes about the film industry in general. There is a common notion that if you want to make it big in the film industry, you need to get used to the 'adjustment' and 'compromise'. These are nothing but euphemisms for sexual assault. 
For the last couple of years, several heroines including Parvathy, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Aishwarya Rajesh and Rakul Preet have been vocal about the issue of the casting couch. Actresses are no longer shy in exposing the dark underbelly of Indian cinema. Some have paid their price for doing so. But they are determined to bring about a change, no matter how small it is at this point. 
Telugu actress Sri Reddy's protest against the casting couch in Tollywood is another fitting example of what is wrong with our society and the film industry. 
'Any film industry is male-dominated': This is a statement that anyone will agree to without opposition. But does this mean women can be taken for granted just because men have the upper hand? 
Sri Reddy was bold enough to get on the streets, nude, to make her point. Her way of handling the situation might not have been inappropriate, but tough times call for tough measures. What she has had to go through is what thousands of aspiring talents go through every day in film industries across the country. 
If there is some success to Sri Reddy's semi-nude protest, it is in the formation of a committee for sexual harassment. It is 2018 and we claim that we are a progressive society. How progressive are we if we cannot treat an actress as a fellow human being? 
The Malayalam film industry has been the forerunner in forming a committee that discuss the issues faced by women. 'Women in Cinema Collective' was formed when one of their fellow actresses was sexually assaulted. 15 women representing Mollywood met Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan with a petition requesting to set up a committee to discuss gender issues. It is a forum to address issues that include lack of security, basic facilities and to ensure women's participation in the industry's activities. 
While this is a welcoming change, every other industry including Kollywood, Sandalwood and Bollywood need to sit up and take notice. Such forums will only encourage young talents to enter cinema. 
Another unsettling issue is that a majority of the actresses still go on to make statements along the lines of 'casting couch exists but we have never faced it'. If at all they come out in the open and take names, they lose out on films. This is the main reason why actresses choose to refrain from pointing out names. 
To put an end to the casting couch, all that needs to be done is speaking out and taking necessary action against these predators. 
Will the other film industries come forward in setting up a committee to avoid what many Sri Reddy's had to face? ",english

KOCHI: The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Thursday said it was evident the deceased Varapuzha native Sreejith sustained injuries in police custody. The Commission also asked the Special Investigation Team probing the case to identify the police officers who assaulted Sreejith. 
As part of the evidence collection in connection with the Sreejith’s alleged custodial death, the SHRC on Thursday examined the documents with the Varapuzha police station. SHRC acting chairperson P Mohanadas conducted the inquiry proceedings. 
“It is evident from the medical certificate issued by the medical officer of the Government Hospital, North Paravur, that Sreejith had not been injured or tortured when he was produced for medical examination after the police took him into custody on Friday,” said the KSHRC statement. “However, Sreejith was later admitted at Aster Medcity in a serious condition. He had been in police custody during the time and the cops had brought him to the hospital. Hence, it is clear Sreejith sustained the injuries while in police custody. The SIT should identify the police officers who assaulted him,” said the statement.The KSHRC also said Sreejith was not involved in the house attack of Vasudevan, who later committed suicide. There was also a statement of a witness saying the cops assaulted Sreejith. 
Guilty will be punished, says CM 
Kanhangad: The government will make no effort to protect those guilty in the custodial death of Sreejith in Ernakulam, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The government will take strict action against those found guilty. The government has no other face. Those who know the LDF Government know it,” he said. The Chief Minister was speaking after inaugurating the P Krishna Pillai Memorial built by the CPM near Belikoth in Kanhangad on Thursday. Vijayan said a team led by an ADGP has been constituted to investigate the alleged custodial death. “The investigation has started and the team will probe all aspects of the case and the guilty will be brought to justice,” he said. 
Chennithala demands judicial probe Kochi: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has demanded a judicial inquiry into the alleged custodial death of Sreejith, a native of Devaswompadam in Varapuzha. “The state government has not taken any action against the Varapuzha SI, against whom allegations have been levelled from various corners. The officers involved in the incident should be removed from service,” he told reporters after visiting Sreejith’s residence at Varapuzha on Thursday. “The police officers have violated all guidelines in Sreejith’s arrest. Sreejith and his brother were subjected to brutal torture inside the lockup. This is the sixth custodial death after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan assumed the office. The lockups in the state are turning deathbeds. However, the Chief Minister is keeping mum on the issue,” Chennithala said. 
State-sponsored murder: BJP Chengannur: BJP national executive committee member P K Krishnadas has said the police arrested Sreejith, of Varappuzha, on the basis of the diktat by CPM local leaders, including district secretary P Rajeev. He said the custodial death of Sreejith was a result of the CPM intervention. “At present, the police are trying to put the blame on Sreejith in the name of trespassing. They had fabricated documents and threatened the witnesses in the case. It was a government-sponsored murder,” he said. He said the BJP would hold a day-long fast in front of the Ernakulam range IG office. Related Article ",english

The Pilicode grama panchayat in Kasaragod has set a model for others to emulate in energy conservation. 
Pilicode, situated at the district’s southern end, is perhaps the first filament bulb-free grama panchayat in the nation and a formal declaration to this effect was made by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at a function at Kalikadavu town on Thursday evening. 
An energy-conservation drive was launched in March 2016 involving voluntary agencies and 117 neighbourhood groups, each having 30 to 60 households. Awareness classes were held for an year on the need to save electricity, grama panchayat president T.V. Sreedharan told The Hindu . 
The sessions yielded results. There was a bimonthly reduction of 1,20,328 units in power consumption in the panchayat in March last year compared to the corresponding period the previous year, he said. 
Buoyed by the energy conservation award, instituted by the State Energy Management Centre (EMC), it received last year, the panchayat accorded priority to energy conservation in its scheme of things. The local body distributed 8,900 pieces of 9 watt LED bulbs through the local KSEB office at ₹70 a bulb and 14,000 LED bulbs at ₹50 a piece through the EMC, Mr. Sreedharan said. 
The awareness classes stressed the need to replace the zero watt conventional bulbs, which consumes 15 watts, with 0.5-watt LED bulbs. Households were also asked to switch off refrigerators between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
The awareness classes imparted to the local people eventually led to the replacement of conventional filament bulbs with the energy-saving LED bulbs over the last two years, he said.",english

Sanilkumar alias Pappanamcode Saji, 38, who is the councillor of Melamcode ward in the city was the one who was attacked. He is also the district general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party. The attack prompted city police to intensify vigil all over the city to prevent any retaliatory attacks. The city has been witnessing political tension between BJP and CPM outfits for the past couple of years, which were marked by one murder and several attempted murders. Saji suffered multiple injuries after being attacked with sharp weapons and iron rods. His friend and BJP Karamana area secretary Prakash, who was with him, has also suffered minor injuries. According to the police, the attack occurred at Thekkekotta under Fort police station limits around 9.30am. He was returning home after attending the post-death rites of a friend at Vallakkadavu. When he Thekkekotta, the assailants, who came on several motorcycles, intercepted him and attacked him. He was hacked using sharp weapons and beaten with blunt iron rods. He suffered serious injuries on the back of his head. Prakash did not suffer any serious injuries as he was attacked only with blunt objects. Hence the police suspect that Saji was the specific target of the assailants. BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan visited Saji at PRS Hospital at Killippalam and alleged that CPM was behind the attack. “Saji is a popular youth leader and Pinarayi Vijayan who is in charge of the home department is answerable from this incident. This is one among the episodes of organized and planned attacks on BJP workers,” Rajasekharan said. However, CPM district secretary Anavoor Nagappan was quick to dismiss this allegation. In a statement issued here, Nagappan condemned the attack and stated that CPM had nothing to do with it. He also demanded Kummanam Rajasekharan to retract his allegation. In protest to the attack, BJP observed hartal at Nemom as a result of which shops there remained shut. The city also witnessed as many as nine protest marches by BJP and RSS at Nemom, Fort, Kudappanakkunnu, Nalanchira, Pongumoodu, Devaswom Board, Kazhakootam, Mannanthala and Vizhinjam. However, no untoward incidents were reported. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) G Jaidev said that since the assailants could not be identified it was hard to confirm whether the attack was indeed a politically motivated one. “We are probing all possible aspects to find out whether it was a political attack or one that was motivated by personal rivalry,” Jaidev said.

TRIVANDRUM: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has warned the “vested interests” against sabotaging the southern state’s essential infrastructure development projects.“Whatever be the objections, we cannot drop the development projects,” he said laying the foundation stone of a bridge in his hometown of Thalassery on Friday.“Everybody wants development, but without acquiring land. That’s the way some people in Kerala think.” Since he assumed power two years back, Vijayan had fast-tracked two significant projects, an LNG pipeline network and the development of roads into four-lane carriageways.Both these federally funded projects envisaging investments worth more than Rs 300 billion and seen as the state’s economic nerve centre were in limbo for last many years due to local resistance fuelled by fringe groups.The state is still witnessing isolated protests due to his government’s failure to adequately communicate to the evictees detailing their compensation package and the police high-handedness.“No mainstream political party is now supporting the demonstrations against the national highway development,” he said.“Now only some vested interests are there with their opposition. We are not going to stop the development by that.” He accused the Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) of delaying these projects when it was in power for five years before being voted out by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) led by his Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM.“The previous LDF government had convened an all-party meeting that reached a consensus on fixing the width of the highways at 45 metres,” he said. “But the UDF government that succeeded did nothing.” Kerala has been debating the need for a high-speed road for the past three decades.It decided to expand its existing highway network into a width of 30 metres three decades ago.Many opposed this citing large-scale destruction of buildings on either side and its impact on the environmental.Two decades back the state proposed a Rs 50 billion greenfield expressway through less inhabited regions with several interjunctions and a mix of tunnels and elevated stretches.

Inaugurating the new building of Karaduka block panchayat in Kasaragod district on Thursday, for which the land was given free of cost by four persons, the chief minister said people of Kerala does not have much land with them and hence it would be difficult for them to part with it but the government cannot abandon the projects just because of that.
“We will ensure their rehabilitation along with the compensation they deserve, which is the responsibility of the government,” he said. He also said the decision of four people to give their land for a development is a model for the State.
The chief minister’s comments come in the backdrop of the protest by the residents of Keezhattur in Kannur against the national highway bypass through their paddy fields.
He said the government was able to acquire land to a considerable extend between Kasaragod and Thalappady. In other States, when the land is acquired for the road, the compensation is around Rs 65 lakh per kilometer, whereas it is around Rs six crore in Kerala, which is very high according to the Central Government , said Pinarayi Vijayan. The State government is trying to amicably settle the issue and union minister Nitin Gadkari has responded positively to it, he added.
At the function, the chief minister also felicitated the four people – Kunjiraman, Damodaran, Balakrishnan, and Sukumaran – who gave away their land for the block panchayat building.
He also said the utilization of the plan fund by the local governments has increased considerably and this is a great achievement. In 2017-18 the utilization is 85 percent, said the chief minister adding that this year the execution of the plans have started in April itself. By next year, we should be able to utilize at least 70 percent of the fund by January itself, he urged.",english

The panchayat achieved this rare distinction by replacing all the filament bulbs by LED bulbs under its unique project ‘Oorjayanam’, which aims to make the panchayat energy efficient, and this has evinced the interest of the district administration, which wants to introduce it in other parts of the district as well.
Making the declaration at Kalikkadavu in Pilicode, the chief minister said the panchayat has gained international attention through this project and it is a model for other panchayats to replicate.
By reducing energy consumption, we will be able to effectively resist the menaces like global warming. If we are able to save one unit of electricity, we will be able to save one kilogram of coal, and this way we can also reduce environmental pollution caused by burning fuels like coal and petroleum, said Pinarayi Vijayan.
He also said the government was considering such a possibility of making the entire State filament-bulb-free. We can also explore the possibility of solar electricity in large scale, said the chief minister, who added that 70 percent of the electricity we require comes from other States. Of the 30 percent being made here, the major share is from hydroelectric projects and there will be fluctuation according to the variation in monsoon.
40000 filament bulbs replaced
Under this project for energy conservation, nearly 40000 filament bulbs were replaced by LED bulbs from the houses, shops and other establishments and this way 120,328 units of electricity was saved last year in the panchayat, according to the panchayat authorities. The project was implemented with the support of Energy Management Centre (EMC) of the State government, which enforces the Energy Conservation Act, 2001.
Pilicode panchayat president Sreedharan T V said this is only the first part of the project, which was started in December 2016, and the aim is to initiate more steps in energy conservation to make the panchayat ‘energy positive’.
Under the project, the EMC supplied the LED bulbs, and the panchayat gave these bulbs, which cost Rs 77, at a subsidized rate of Rs 50 to the customers, said the panchayat officials.
As part of the project, the panchayat had conducted a survey in all the households with regards to the use of electric bulbs and other electric gadgets, and also got the details about the energy-inefficient gadgets. Based on that information, they were sensitized the way to reduce energy consumption through various steps, including switching off the refrigerator between 6 pm to 10 pm.",english

In a response posted on his social media page, the chief minister said what the child had experienced would enrage and move any human being to tears. “Holding the girl in captivity at a temple fanatics then preying on her people’s representatives then occupying the streets in favour of the accused persons. The country hangs its head in shame over such ‘good days’,” he said. It was not the rape and killing alone that mattered, the reasons that led to such a ghastly incident were also equally important. “The little girl was raped and killed in the name of religion. It shows the dreadful situation in the country under Sangh Parivar rule. Those who use even temples for such acts and the Sangh Parivar forces who support it are leading the nation towards dark ages of brutality. Sangh Parivar is being driven by pseudo love for religion and pseudo nationalism,” he said. Vijayan added that it was time the country woke up and rally for the cause of the hapless girl child. Meanwhile, BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan petitioned state police chief against the chief minister for revealing the name and photograph of the rape victim over social media platforms. “It’s not ignorance that prompted the CM to do that. By trying to give a communal tinge to the incident, his real intention has been revealed. BJP has filed a complaint with the DGP against the CM. The crime committed by him could attract imprisonment up to two years,” Rajasekharan said. He said the stand taken by the Jammu government was exemplary. “Since chargesheet was submitted in 90 days, there is no possibility for the accused persons to get bail,” he said. Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the attempts by the BJP, Sangh Parivar forces to protect those accused in rape cases were bringing shame to the entire country. Congress on Friday organized meetings across the state in protest against the rapes and killings. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy inaugurated the protest meet at Martyrs’ Square at Palayam here.

Most southern states are up in arms against the disadvantage they fear they might suffer if the Central pool of tax funds is shared the way they suspect New Delhi wants. Their complaint is that they are being penalised for their good performance. Is there an anti-south bias? 
‘GLORIFIED MUNICIPALITIES’ is an expression that Kerala’s Finance Minister TM Thomas Isaac has lately been using to describe what he claims would be the likely fate of India’s better-performing states in the face of escalating ‘fiscal terrorism’ by the Union Government. What has aroused the ire of this economist-politician is an order issued by the President constituting the Fifteenth Finance Commission (the panel that recommends how to share the Central pool of tax funds among states), whose Terms of Reference (ToRs) prompted him to convene a first-of- its-kind conclave of finance ministers of southern states on April 10th. Last year, Isaac had earned plaudits from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his quality inputs during discussions held in the run-up to the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax, an indirect tax that has replaced several others in the country since. But now, he is at odds with the Centre. 
The one-day meet held in Thiruvananthapuram, attended by leaders of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry, apart from Kerala, concluded with a decision to call another such gathering in Visakhapatnam within a fortnight to chart out an action plan to voice the concerns of ‘progressive states’ that they argued would bear the brunt of a new ‘aggressive and unitary’ posture adopted by the Centre. 
For the next summit, Isaac hopes to enlist Tamil Nadu, which pulled out of the April 10th one despite having initially agreed to participate, as well as the northern and eastern states of Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal and Odisha. He has said he is not averse to the idea of inviting BJP-ruled states, such as Goa and others, to discuss “injustices” meted out to states doing well on the achievement of social development targets. 
In Thiruvananthapuram, leaders of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh spoke out against a new brand of policy that they contend is emerging: of the Centre penalising successful states and incentivising laggards. In an interview with Open , Isaac says that neither he nor others at the conclave are against the idea of equity, nor are they against helping states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh emerge from their backwardness. 
Krishna Byre Gowda, the agriculture minister of Karnataka, has been quoted as saying that the group voicing dissent is ready to engage with the Fifteenth Finance Commission in an effort to have their grievances redressed. While a win-win solution is possible, goes his argument, the Union Government should not create winners and losers. His disgruntlement stems from the ToRs. These, he alleges, are designed to hurt progressive states for they give the Centre the discretionary authority to “play as it pleases”; by this, he implies it may want to favour some and disadvantage others. “By weakening the strongest parts of the Union, you are weakening the Union itself,” he states. 
Speaking to Open , C Ponnaiyan, a former finance minister of Tamil Nadu and organising secretary of the AIADMK who is now a close associate of the state’s Deputy Chief Minister O Paneerselvam (who also hold the finance portfolio), calls the conclave a “paper tiger”. It is not unusual for Union governments to display such unitary tendencies, he says, especially vis-à-vis states south of the Vindhyas. S Thirunavukkarasar, a Congress veteran from the state, says that the Tamil Nadu government’s “last-minute” refusal to attend the conclave of April 10th smacks of slavish mentality and is symptomatic of the state’s current lack of strong leadership. Rivals decry the post-Jayalalithaa AIADMK, which holds power in Chennai, as a collective of indecisive leaders with no charisma. “They are scared to even stand up for their rights,” says a Congress leader, “After all, Tamil Nadu is one state that will be worst hit by the ToRs.” 
Andhra Pradesh’s Finance Minister Yanamala Rama Krishnudu, who attended the meet, has also lashed out at Centre for using the Finance Commission as a “political tool”. So has Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, who made his point clear in his address at the gathering. 
The conclave concluded with a decision to call another gathering to chart out an action plan to voice the concerns of ‘progressive states’ that they argued would bear the brunt of a new ‘aggressive and unitary’ posture adopted by the Centre 
AT VISAKHAPATNAM, the group expect to draft a joint memorandum against the ToRs they have such strong objections to. As Kerala’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan tells Open , “This is not just a south-versus-north issue, but a Centre- state relations debate.” For some southern states, the contentious clauses of the ToRs include the use of ‘population data of 2011 while making [the Commission’s] recommendations’, as opposed to the figures of 1971 or a mix of 1971 and 2011. Some states are also peeved that the ToRs lay down conditions for tax sharing, which they say is a violation of the Constitution. According to Isaac, the document suggests that the increase in states’ share of tax revenue from 32 to 42 per cent made by the previous Commission was an excessive step. The group also condemns the attempt to boost Centrally sponsored schemes, arguing that several progressive states have their own schemes that deliver better outcomes. 
The question, then, is: how justified is this anger? 
At an administrative level, the controversy over the use of population data from the 2011 census instead of the 1971 one appears superfluous. Under the ToRs of the previous Finance Commission, it was asked while making its recommendations to ‘generally take the base of population figures as of 1971 in all cases where population is a factor for determination of devolution of taxes and duties and grants-in-aid’. But those ToRs had also added that ‘the Commission may also take into account the demographic changes that have taken place subsequent to 1971’. On April 10th, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley clarified this point in a Facebook post, in which he said, ‘The 14th [Finance Commission] had no specific mandate for using the 2011 census. Yet, the 14th FC rightly used the 2011 census population data to capture the demographic changes since 1971 to make a realistic assessment of the needs of the States. It allocated 10% weight to the 2011 population.’

The real reasons for the disquiet—apart from the usual myopic political ones that arise close to elections—are different. The forum of leaders who met in Thiruvananthapuram had even hinted at them. Kerala’s Vijayan was explicit on that score when he said, “Reframing of the Terms of Reference is imperative to strengthen the federal structure of the country on the one hand and to reinforce the unity and integrity of the nation on the other.” 
There are two ways to look at the issue. One is to consider it from the old lens of the Union Government trying to control the states. There’s plenty in the ToRs that can be spun that way. Take the clause that asks the Commission to consider the ‘conditions that Government of India may impose on the States while providing consent under Article 293(3) of the Constitution’. This article limits the power of states to borrow money if they have not fully repaid a loan given to them by either the Union Government or any other lender to which the Centre had provided its assurance as debt guarantor. The Constitution empowers the Union Government to lay down the parameters under which such consent can be given, something which it has asked the Fifteenth Finance Commission to do. 
The other way to look at the issue is to consider this an attempt to nudge the states to carry out economic reforms that they have been reluctant to. This is the nub of the problem: the Centre is under constant pressure to keep the country’s overall fiscal deficit— the combined deficit for the Union and state governments— under check. In recent years, states have recklessly been spending, which complicates the overall task of macroeconomic management— keeping both the deficit and interest rates low. This has an adverse impact on the whole country’s economic growth. 
“Neither I nor others at the conclave are against the idea of equity, nor are we against helping states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh emerge from their backwardness” - TM Thomas Isaac, finance minister, Kerala 
That overriding concern is clear from New Delhi’s attempt to craft performance-based incentives that the Finance Commission has been tasked with. Some of them are political red rags. For example, the Commission has been asked to take into account ‘control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures’ by the states. Anyone familiar with India’s political economy knows that at the state level, the name of the game is to spend and win polls, with the expenditure calibrated to get the biggest bang for every buck. To expect that a reversal of populist schemes would be accepted tamely by the states—even if a body of technocrats has been given the mandate to look at the issue—is politically naïve. 
There are a slew of such ToRs for the Commission, something that no government in the past has had the courage to ask for. In that sense, the present dispensation at the Centre has bitten the bullet of moderating populism. A look at these ToRs shows that claims of partiality towards northern over southern states are unfounded. To cite one example, the Commission has been asked to consider proposing incentives that take into account ‘efforts and progress made in moving towards replacement rate of population growth’. If such measures are framed, accepted and implemented by the Union Government, then UP and Bihar would be the biggest losers, contrary to the furious debate about southern states ‘subsidising’ northern laggards. 
What has been forgotten in the noisome north-versus-south argument is that all constitutional bodies use a number of factors while deciding on issues within their purview. The Finance Commission is no different. If population is a factor for deciding devolution of taxes and so on, then so are countervailing and special circumstances as well. This time, the Commission has been asked to look at incentives— or more accurately disincentives—on managing population. After Andhra Pradesh was divided in 2014, the previous Finance Commission was asked to look into the availability of resources after the division of the state well after it had begun its proceedings. When the final award was presented in December that year, Andhra Pradesh was given Rs1.69 lakh crore as its share in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 2015 to 2020, a substantial increase over the Rs 1.14 lakh crore awarded by the previous Commission. In addition, the state was also given help to bridge its revenue deficit due to revenue losses after Telangana was hived off. 
Yet, four years later, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu argues that tax revenues from south India are being used to fund development activities in the north. Such claims contradict other arguments made by the state. If tax collections from Andhra are disproportionately high, then surely it has enough commercial activity not to need Special Category status, which is meant for underdeveloped states that do not have such an advantage and require extra finances from the Centre. The Raghuram Rajan Committee that examined the issue of which states deserve this tag had devised an underdevelopment index based on per capita Net Domestic Product. States like Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh are far needier than Andhra Pradesh on this index, and yet, none of them qualify for Special Category status. Andhra Pradesh suffers from none of the usual debilitating features such as poor terrain, lack of development, etcetera, that many of India’s remote states do. It was a political accident that it was bifurcated. 
‘The 14th Finance Commission had no specific mandate for using 2011 census. Yet, 14th FC rightly used the 2011 census population data to capture the demographic changes since 1971 to make a realistic assessment of the needs of the States. It allocated 10% weight to the 2011 population’ - Arun Jaitley, Union finance minister 
Historically, none of the reasons offered by better-off states for a greater share of resources has had any merit. At one point, Punjab used to make an argument similar to the one being made now by southern states. The state’s grouse was that due to its relatively small population, it received less from the Central pool of taxes. In its support, Punjab claimed that it had 2 per cent of India’s geographic area but contributed as much as half the Central pool of foodgrains, thus playing a major role in India’s food security at a time when virtually all other states had a food deficit. Much like Karnataka’s argument about ‘progressivism’ today, what Punjab left unsaid was that its supplies to the Central pool were fully paid for by the Union Government from tax revenues raised across the country. 
Meanwhile, a Government official who was closely involved in the parleys over drafting the ToRs says that the language used in the Presidential order may have aggravated matters. He says that the “original wordings” were terrible and what is in the public domain now is a “much diluted” version compared with the one “that a senior official wanted”. He also believes that certain aspects of the order need not have been there. “That includes assertions such as ‘the Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all’”. In his opinion, it is not the Finance Commission that is meant to make such statements, but the Finance Ministry. He also takes exception to conditions placed on states to avail of loans, and is piqued that the ToRs refer to the earlier Commission while the new one ought to have started off on a clean slate. Such criticisms apart, this official is more worried that institutions are being undermined by various forces even though contentious issues can be sorted out through confabulations. Though he does not elaborate, he says that the Special Status demand by Andhra Pradesh could have been handled better had a senior official not shown lack of dexterity. 
As for the language and content of the ToRs, NK Singh, chairman of the Fifteenth Finance Commission, would like to remind everyone that the body has no role in drafting them. “We just receive it from the President after it has been cleared by the Cabinet,” he tells Open . Likewise, Dr Anoop Singh, a member of the Commission and adjunct professor at Georgetown University, has this to say in an email response: ‘I should reiterate that we are guided by and bound by the terms of reference given to us by the President.’ 
Bibek Debroy, head of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and a Niti Aayog member who has often spoken of a trade-off between equity and efficiency, tells Open that states should ideally present their case to the Finance Commission. “One should recognise the constitutional role of the Commission,” he says, “All states invariably hold discussions with [it], and therefore all grievances have to be submitted to it.” Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, has not responded to Open ’s specific queries so far on three issues that have irked the southern states: the ToR’s increased stress on Central schemes over states programmes; the suggestion to relook at the 42 per cent tax devolution to the states; and a likely review of the provision of revenue deficit grants. Another government official, however, says that the Centre has genuine reason to worry about reduced resources at its command. 
Professor Prerna Singh of Brown University, the author of How Solidarity works for Welfare: Subnationalism and Social Development in India , says it is true that some southern states for decades have been characterised by much lower fertility rates and higher social indicators than northern states, and that these have been the result of explicit social policies. “These social policies have required a great degree of political will to enact and societal mobilisation to implement,” she says, “Southern states such as Kerala, and also Tamil Nadu, made social welfare a priority in the decades after Independence and devoted precious budgetary outlays to social schemes. At this time, some of these southern states such as Kerala were actually in a more precarious financial position than north-central Indian states such as UP. Yet, they chose to make this commitment to social welfare. And so it is understandable that they do not wish to be penalised for this early and sustained commitment to social welfare that is reflected in their lower fertility and higher welfare rates today.” 
However, as Professor Singh adds, “It is important to keep in mind that talking about ‘laggard’ northern states versus ‘progressive’ southern states obscures important differences between these states within these regions. Andhra Pradesh, for example, at many points in the last few decades has been characterised by social welfare indicators at par with the Hindi heartland. In the 1990s, Rajasthan saw an important commitment to and consequent jump in educational indicators. Recently, there has emerged a significant and unprecedented focus on social welfare in Bihar.” 
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu argues that tax revenues from south India are being used to fund development in the north. Such claims contradict the state’s demand for Special Category status 
On the possibility of southern resentment resulting in the rise of subnationalist forces within these states, Professor Singh says that tensions between regions are not unusual in a federal set- up. “But jurisdictional changes that structurally disadvantage or are perceived to disadvantage certain regions as compared to others have historically been important triggers for the development of regional discontent. At various points in time—for example, in the 1970s—discontent because of Central policies that are perceived to disadvantage their state has fuelled subnationalism in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that in India certain states have historically been the site of powerful subnationalist movements.” Her book delves into how such subnationalism has been a significant force behind the social policies of these states. “So, increased regional discontent in the context of long-standing, deeply rooted, powerful subnationalisms could be an especially potent challenge to Indian federalism,” she says. 
At the moment, the divisive effects of high population in India are being debated in terms of Finance Commission awards. But there is a deeper reason behind the southern unease. In 1971, the combined population of UP and Bihar was roughly 125 million. The four southern states then, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu accounted for 145 million people. By 2011, the preponderance had inverted: the two northern states now had 303 million people and the southern states (including Telangana, which was a part of Andhra Pradesh then) had 251 million. As of now, the number of seats each state has in the Lok Sabha is based on numbers from the 1971 census. The Vajpayee Government had frozen that arrangement until 2026. When a new delimitation exercise is carried out based on 2011 census data, the southern states would lose several seats in Parliament while the cumulative representation of UP and Bihar would rise substantially. Even now, the two states account for a vast chunk. 
When that happens, the sheer weight of northern states in Parliament, and consequently in politics and policymaking, has the potential to overwhelm almost all others. There is virtually nothing that can be done to fix that skew. In a democracy, representation is a matter of numbers, and these favour the north. It is not clear if there is a constitutional solution for this. Even if compensatory measures are taken to assure the south its voice in national affairs (say, by granting it higher Rajya Sabha representation), it would call for a constitutional change, which would perhaps face resistance in any given political scenario. However, if the current trend of increasing northern dominance persists, geographical fissures could emerge in the country. This would pose dangers. Northern states being split into smaller ones might relieve the state-wise disparities of power, but the north-south divergence would still require other modes of addressal. 
In their efforts right now, the southern states could be making a strategic mistake: if they succeed in altering the ToRs they are ranged against, the northern states may end up demanding delimitation based on the 2011 census, which would reduce the south’s influence in New Delhi. Perhaps a way to prevent that outcome is some sort of trade-off between letting states such as UP and Bihar get a larger share of financial resources now, in return for a correction in political representation at a later stage. Southern states also seem to discount the fact that the Finance Commission may make a greater allowance for ‘progress made in moving towards replacement rate of population growth’, as stated in the ToRs, than what they seem to assume. 
The current debate that has generated much heat has made one thing clear: population and its political and economic effects can no longer be ignored. Left unaddressed, India runs the risk of a Malthusian quagmire. SHARE",english

P Sudhakaran | TNN | April 13, 2018, 12:38 IST Newsletter A A KANNUR: Pilicode panchayat in Kasaragod, which won the State Energy Conservation award last year, has added yet another feather in its cap by becoming the first village panchayat in the country that has completely abandoned filament bulbs, and this declaration was made by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.The panchayat achieved this rare distinction by replacing all the filament bulbs by LED bulbs under its unique project ‘Oorjayanam’, which aims to make the panchayat energy efficient, and this has evinced the interest of the district administration, which wants to introduce it in other parts of the district as well.Making the declaration at Kalikkadavu in Pilicode, the chief minister said the panchayat has gained international attention through this project and it is a model for other panchayats to replicate.By reducing energy consumption, we will be able to effectively resist the menaces like global warming. If we are able to save one unit of electricity, we will be able to save one kilogram of coal, and this way we can also reduce environmental pollution caused by burning fuels like coal and petroleum, said Pinarayi Vijayan.He also said the government was considering such a possibility of making the entire State filament-bulb-free. We can also explore the possibility of solar electricity in large scale, said the chief minister, who added that 70 percent of the electricity we require comes from other States. Of the 30 percent being made here, the major share is from hydroelectric projects and there will be fluctuation according to the variation in monsoon.40000 filament bulbs replacedUnder this project for energy conservation, nearly 40000 filament bulbs were replaced by LED bulbs from the houses, shops and other establishments and this way 120,328 units of electricity was saved last year in the panchayat, according to the panchayat authorities. The project was implemented with the support of Energy Management Centre (EMC) of the State government, which enforces the Energy Conservation Act, 2001.Pilicode panchayat president Sreedharan T V said this is only the first part of the project, which was started in December 2016, and the aim is to initiate more steps in energy conservation to make the panchayat ‘energy positive’.Under the project, the EMC supplied the LED bulbs, and the panchayat gave these bulbs, which cost Rs 77, at a subsidized rate of Rs 50 to the customers, said the panchayat officials.As part of the project, the panchayat had conducted a survey in all the households with regards to the use of electric bulbs and other electric gadgets, and also got the details about the energy-inefficient gadgets. Based on that information, they were sensitized the way to reduce energy consumption through various steps, including switching off the refrigerator between 6 pm to 10 pm. RELATED ",english

Knanaya Community which migrated to Malabar region of the present Kerala State (old British Malabar and South Canara) is celebrating the Platinum Jubilee of that historic moment. Due to acute difficulty and poverty caused by Second World War, people in central Travancore ventured to take risk and migrate to North part of Kerala. But isolated migration to Malabar was a failure and the individuals had to face severe obstacles and hardships. Chev. V J Joseph Kandoth presented a possibility of Knanaya Migration to Malabar. Mar Alexander Chulaparambil, second bishop of Kottayam, supported the idea and sent messages to people for the same. He sent a circular to gather people who were willing to go over to Malabar for migration.
As in the manner of first migration to Kodungalloor in AD 345, 72 Southist families were selected to migrate to South Canara (Rajapuram colony) in February (2-4) 1943. Then there took place another migration to Madamapam colony in May (6-8) 1943, and third one to Ranipuram in 1970 (January 26-27). Fr Jacob Mudakalil, Fr Luke Kattappurath, Fr Mathew Cherusseril, Monsignor Mathew Theccanatt and Monsignor Cyriac Mattathil were the priests who supported the communities on their initial struggles. The Knanaya community in Malabar achieved tremendous progress and now it is the 75 th year of Migration. Mar Alexander Chulapparambil and Prof V J Joseph Kandoth were the inspiration and pioneers for the venture.
The whole Knanaya community now thanks God for the providence and protection all through the years. Mar Mathew Moolakkatt, the supreme head and Metropolitan of the community, Mar Joseph Pandarasseril, auxiliary bishop of Kottayam and the faithful celebrated Holy Qurbana on the occasion. There is a rally in Kannur town on 14 April 2018 in connection with the platinum Jubilee celebration. Flag off of the march was done by Fr Michael Vetticatt, the vicar general of the Archdiocese of Kottayam.

Pinarayi Vijayan Most federations in the world have arangements for the mobilisation and devolution of resources. In India, the Constitution provides for the appointment of a Finance Commission every five years to recommend methodology to share resources such that the fiscal space of the constituents, especially the States, is well protected. The terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission are thus a matter of utmost importance to the resources available to the States of India. The terms of reference of this Commission have created apprehension among States about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of public resources for development. This article deals with some general matters of principle in this regard. Vital for unity First, Article 1 of the Constitution of India recognises India as a Union of States. The unity of India can be preserved only if there is real fairness and equity in the matter of devolution of powers and resources to the States by the Central government. The foremost objective of the Finance Commission is an equitable distribution of financial resources between the two units of the Union. Even a cursory glance at the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution shows that in the allocation of duties between the Centre and the States, fundamental tasks of enhancing human development, income growth, livelihoods, and protecting and sustaining the environment are entrusted to the States. However, although these major tasks of nation-building are the duty of the States, the resources to finance them are substantially controlled by the Centre. I emphasise this point: the States in India today neither have the resources to fulfil their tasks as laid down in the Constitution, nor do they have the right to raise such resources. The present situation is not because of the action or inaction of the States but is directly the consequence of Central government policy. There is thus a great asymmetry in India’s federal system. The Centre’s capacity to mobilise resources is far greater than that of the States, but the latter are required to undertake development expenditures that far exceed their revenue generating capabilities. The Constitution of India entrusts the Finance Commission with the responsibility of addressing this anomaly. So the basic mandate of the Finance Commission should be seen as that of deciding an appropriate quantum of unconditional devolution of resources from the Centre to the States, combined with more specific grants. The devolution of resources by the 15th Finance Commission assumes further significance in the current environment, in which the finances of States have received a double blow in the form of demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The freedom of States to raise resources has been restricted by the introduction of the GST. They now have hardly any major tax left with them to make a difference to State resources. Demographic differences Second, using the population data of 2011 as the base for tax devolution should not reduce the allocation of resources to States that have successfully reduced their rate of population growth. These States have incurred huge fiscal costs in order to achieve a lower population growth and healthy demographic indicators. They have made substantial investments on education, health and directly on family welfare programmes. Bringing down the rate of growth of population does not mean less expenditure for States. On the contrary, it creates new commitments by the States to those in the labour force and to senior citizens. Many States of India today have achieved a replacement rate of growth of population or have gone below that rate in a short span of time. An immediate effect of this is a sharp rise in the proportion of elderly in the population. The care of the elderly is the responsibility of State governments. The enhanced costs of such care must be considered by the Commission in making its awards and in deciding the population criterion to be used. Third, the current terms of reference go far beyond the constitutional mandate of the Finance Commission. Indeed, they intensify efforts to use the Finance Commission as an instrument of fiscal consolidation and to impose the ideological and economic agenda of the Central government on the States. It is not the task of a Finance Commission to recommend “road maps for fiscal management” or to impose its perception of what policies are good for the people of the States. That is for democratically elected State governments to decide. Fourth, this blatant interventionism finds further and dangerous expression in a statement that should not find a place in any list of terms of reference, that is: “the Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all.” Revenue deficits are offshoots of the path of development followed by States and cannot be brought down in the short term. For instance, Kerala’s human development achievements are built on its investments in the people – in social sectors, health and education in particular. Public expenditure on them is a large part of the government spending and it has not been easy to bring down revenue deficits despite higher tax efforts. To discontinue post-tax devolution of revenue deficit grants would go against the principle of cooperative federalism. Fifth, the terms of reference explicitly privilege the “committed expenditures” of the Centre. We should request the Commission to affirm its constitutional status and responsibility by upholding federalism and fiscal autonomy of the States. The Finance Commission should not take a “residual approach” to the question of vertical devolution. The approach should not be that of distributing what is left over after providing for the requirements of the Centre. Ideological agenda Sixth, the terms of reference are unprecedented in asking the 15th Finance Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and is an attempt to micro-manage the fiscal domain of the State governments. Let us not forget that in many spheres of activity, States have set the agenda for development. These sectors include health, education, forest management, public distribution of food, agricultural production – the list goes on. Such development was not because the concerned States received Central incentives. Best practices were created on their own initiative. Thus, for the Finance Commission to propose “measurable performance-based-incentives” is nothing short of an attack on the federal structure mandated by the Constitution. It is not the duty of the Finance Commission to venture into the realm of day-to-day governance. The elected governments of States will decide what policies are appropriate for our people. It is also not for the Finance Commission to declare this or that policy as “populist”. Any measure, from welfare pensions for the poor and weaker sections of the society to food assistance, can be termed as “populist” and recommended to be curtailed. This strikes at the root of a democratic polity in which State governments are free to implement welfare measures, albeit within conditions of fiscal responsibility. The fiscal argument Seventh, it is not correct that the fiscal space available to the Centre has shrunk following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The argument today that an increase in devolution from 32% to 42% led to a reduction of the fiscal space available to the Union government is not borne out by the evidence. In practice, when implementing the award of the 14th Finance Commission, the Union government cut allocations to several Centrally Sponsored Schemes in 2015-16. The cutback was almost equal to the amount received by the States as a whole on account of the rise in share of taxes and duties. Thus, there was no squeeze of the fiscal space available to the Union government, because it had protected itself. In fact, the total resources devolved from the Union to all States put together has been declining as a share of GDP for some years now. There is no ground for reducing the share of States in the vertical devolution. The presumption now appears to be that the relative responsibility for development is shifting from the States to the Centre. Such a presumption, if accepted by the Commission, would shrink the fiscal space of the States and expand that of the Union government. India’s great wealth rests in its diversity. To recognise this diversity is also to recognise that States will follow diverse paths of development. The Finance Commission must facilitate diversity and a democratic path of development by respecting principles of equity and fairness in allocating resources between the Centre and States in India.

The gruesome rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua has snowballed into a unique campaign against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Sangh Parivar in the southern Indian state of Kerala. 
The saffron party, which is gearing up for a show of strength in the upcoming bypoll in Chengannur ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, is rattled by a poster campaign calling for the ban of partymen in houses with young girls. 
The campaign, which originated at Vamanapuram in Thiruvananthapuram district on 13 April with posters pasted on the gates of several houses banning the entry of BJP workers, soon spread to different parts of the state. Representational image. PTI 
A printed poster pasted on the gate of a house at Kalamachal in the state capital read: ""Sanghis not welcome in this home. There are small children here."" 
A similar poster was also found outside an Anganwadi (childcare centre) at Cherthala in Alappuzha district. But what has caused concern in BJP circles is the appearance of different versions of the poster in poll-bound Chengannur. The posters warned the partymen from entering houses seeking votes. 
""This house has girls aged less than 10 years. BJP workers may please not enter here asking for votes,"" said a poster that appeared in front of a house at Puliyoor area in the constituency. 
Another poster in the area says: ""Leave your leaflets seeking votes outside the gate, we have under-10 girls in the house."" 
A Times of India report said that the posters were removed by the police following intervention by local BJP leaders. 
However, PS Sreedharan Pillai, BJP candidate at Chengannur, feigned ignorance about the poster campaign in the constituency. He told Fistpost that the posters had not come to his notice. 
The BJP leader said that the campaign may have been launched by Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers out of frustration. The party has been indulging in dirty tactics after a state intelligence report placed it in the third position at Chengannur. 
""The campaign will not have any impact in the by-election. The people at Chengannur are disenchanted with both the fronts. We secured 42,862 votes in the 2016 elections. We are confident that we can win this time,” said Pillai, who is a former state chief of BJP. 
However, the party has been put on the defensive with social media picking up the campaign in a big way. Photographs of the posters in Chengannur as well as other parts of the state have gone viral on social media. They are being widely shared on Twitter and Facebook under the hashtag 'BalatkariJanataParty'. 
Links of media reports listing cases involving BJP leaders across the country have also been posted on Twitter. A November 2013 Times of India report regarding the arrest of Sringeri BJP MLA DN Jeevaraj in poll-bound Karnataka topped the list. 
The poster campaign learnt to have originated after a private bank employee known for his RSS affiliation justified the rape and murder of the minor Kathua girl. Vishnu Nandakumar, working as assistant manager of Kotak Mahindra Bank at Palarivattom branch in Kochi, had tweeted: “It is good that she was murdered at this young age. Else, she would have grown up to be a suicide bomber.” 
Nandakumar's remark invitean d angry response from hundreds on social media. They started a campaign for his removal under hashtag 'dismiss_your_manager'. They also bombarded the bank’s branches in various parts of the state with calls, seeking his removal from service. 
As the bank’s rating in its Facebook started dipping, the bank terminated Nandakumar and condemned the remark. ""We have terminated Nandakumar from the services for poor performance. It is extremely disheartening to see such comments being made in the aftermath of such tragedy by anyone. We strongly condemn this statement,” a post on the bank's Facebook page said . 
The rape and murder of the eight-year-old girl in Kathua evoked strong protests from all sections of people in the state as well. Joining a midnight protest staged by Congress president Rahul Gandhi at India Gate in New Delhi, the party's Kerala unit organised meetings across the state on 13 April. 
The pro-Muslim Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) also staged protests in different parts of the state condemning the incident and demanding justice for the victim’s family. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a post in his Facebook page that the ghastly incident has made the entire country hang its head in shame. He said that what the child had experienced would enrage and move any human being to tears. 
""It was not the rape and killing alone that mattered, the reasons that led to such a ghastly incident were also equally important. The little girl was raped and killed in the name of religion. It shows the dreadful situation in the country under Sangh Parivar rule,"" he said. 
The Kerala chief minister also said that those who used a temple for such activities and the Sangh Parivar forces who support it were leading the nation towards dark ages of brutality. ""Sangh Parivar is being driven by pseudo love for religion and pseudo nationalism,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan countered him by lodging a complaint with Director General of Police against the chief minister for revealing the name and photograph of the rape victim over the social media. 
He alleged that the chief minister had violated the Supreme Court guidelines in this regard not because of his ignorance but in his anxiety to give a communal colour to the incident. ""This will not work. The Jammu and Kashmir government has taken exemplary action in the case,"" he added. 
Pillai has also questioned the motive behind the current wave of protests over the incident saying that it had taken place in January and the accused were arrested in February. The protests have erupted after the chargesheet was filed. 
""The protestors should hail the Jammu and Kashmir government for filing the chargesheet within 90 days. This will prevent the accused to get bail,” he said adding that the people in the country will see through the game and continue to back the party.

ജില്ലാ പൊലീസ് മേധാവിയുടെ മേൽനോട്ടത്തിൽ വേണം അടിയന്തരമായി ക്യാമറ സ്ഥാപിക്കേണ്ടത്. ക്യാമറ സ്ഥാപിച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞു ബില്ല് ജില്ലാ പൊലീസ് നൽകിയാൽ പണം നൽകും. ഈ ക്യാമറ ദൃശ്യങ്ങൾ സ്റ്റേഷനിലെ കംപ്യൂട്ടർ വഴി റിക്കോർഡ് ചെയ്യണം. എല്ലാ ആഴ്ചയും ഈ സിഡിയിൽ റിക്കോർഡ് ചെയ്തു സൂക്ഷിക്കണമെന്നും ഡിജിപി വ്യക്തമാക്കി. വരാപ്പുഴ കസ്റ്റഡി മരണവുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടും ജനങ്ങളോടുള്ള മോശം പെരുമാറ്റത്തിലൂടെയും പൊലീസ് പ്രതിസ്ഥാനത്തായതോടെയാണ് സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ നടക്കുന്ന ദൈനംദിന കാര്യങ്ങൾ സൂക്ഷ്മമായി നിരീക്ഷിക്കാനുള്ള തീരുമാനം. 
സംസ്ഥാനത്താകെ 527 പൊലീസ് സ്റ്റേഷനുകളുണ്ട്. ഇതിൽ എട്ടു സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ വനിതാ ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥർ മാത്രമാണ്. അതേസമയം, പണം നൽകാതെ ക്യാമറ സ്ഥാപിക്കാൻ നിർദ്ദേശിച്ചതു വ്യാപക അഴിമതിക്ക് ഇടയാക്കുമെന്ന് ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥർ ചൂണ്ടിക്കാട്ടി. 5000 രൂപ വരെ വിലയുള്ള ക്യാമറ ഡീലർമാരെ വിരട്ടി സ്ഥാപിക്കേണ്ടി വരും. പൊലീസിന് ഇത്തരത്തിൽ നൽകുന്ന ചെയ്തു നൽകുന്ന ഒരു കാര്യത്തിനും മുകളിൽനിന്നു ഫണ്ട് നൽകിയാലും ഡീലർക്കു കൈമാറാറില്ല. നിലവിൽ സംസ്ഥാനത്തെ 110 സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ സിസിടിവി ക്യാമറകൾ സ്ഥാപിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. എന്നാൽ പൊലീസുകാർ ഇത് എപ്പോഴും ഓഫാക്കി വയ്ക്കും. മേലുദ്യോഗസ്ഥർ ദൃശ്യങ്ങൾ പരിശോധിക്കാറുമില്ല. 
ഇതിനു പുറമെ 279 പൊലീസ് സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ നൂതന നിരീക്ഷണ ക്യാമറാ സംവിധാനം ഏർപ്പെടുത്താൻ ഡിജിപി തീരുമാനിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. മൂന്നു മാസത്തിനകം ഇതു സ്ഥാപിക്കും. മേലുദ്യോഗസ്ഥർക്കു മൊബൈൽ ഫോണിലൂടെയോ കംപ്യൂട്ടറിലൂടെയോ ഈ സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിലെ ദൃശ്യങ്ങൾ കാണാനും അവസരമുണ്ടാകും. നേരത്തെ, ഒരു പ്രത്യേക കമ്പനിയുടെ ഒരേ നിറത്തിലുള്ള പെയിന്റ് എല്ലാ സ്റ്റേഷനിലും അടിക്കണമെന്ന് ഉത്തരവിട്ടതു പോലെ ഒരു പ്രത്യേക കമ്പനിയുടെ നിരീക്ഷണ ക്യാമറകളാണ് ഈ സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ സ്ഥാപിക്കുന്നത്. ഇവർക്കു ടെണ്ടർ ലഭിക്കുന്ന തരത്തിലാണു പൊലീസ് ആസ്ഥാനത്തു നിബന്ധനകളും തയാറാക്കിയത്. പൊലീസ് നവീകരണ ഫണ്ടിൽനിന്നു ലക്ഷങ്ങളാണ് ഇതിനായി ചെലവിടുന്നത്. ഇതു സ്ഥാപിക്കുന്നതോടെ ഇപ്പോൾ ഈ സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ സ്ഥാപിച്ച താൽകാലിക സംവിധാനം ഉപയോഗശൂന്യമാകുമെന്ന് ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥർ പറഞ്ഞു. 
അതിനിടെ, കസ്റ്റഡി പീഡനത്തിന്റെ പേരിൽ നടപടി നേരിടുന്ന ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥരെ തിരിച്ചെടുക്കാൻ റേഞ്ച് ഐജിയുടെയോ ഡിജിപിയുടെയോ രേഖാമൂലമുള്ള അനുമതി വേണമെന്നു മറ്റൊരു സർക്കുലറിൽ ലോക്നാഥ് ബെഹ്റ നിർദ്ദേശിച്ചു. മുൻപു കസ്റ്റഡി പീഡനത്തിന്റെ പേരിൽ സസ്പെൻഷനോ അച്ചടക്ക നടപടിയോ നേരിട്ട ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥരെ വിവാദം തണുക്കുമ്പോൾ രഹസ്യമായി സർവീസിൽ തിരിച്ചെടുക്കുന്നതു പതിവാണ്. അവരുടെ പേരിലെ കേസും തേച്ചുമാച്ചു കളയും. സിബിഐ ഏറ്റെടുത്ത കേസുകളല്ലാത്ത മിക്ക കസ്റ്റഡി മരണവും ഇത്തരത്തിൽ കേരള പൊലീസ് അട്ടിമറിച്ചിരുന്നു. ഇതുകൂടി കണക്കിലെടുത്താണു വാരാപ്പുഴ കേസിലെ ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥരെ മുൻനിർത്തി ഡിജിപി ഇത്തരം സർക്കുലർ പുറപ്പെടുവിച്ചത്. × Advertisement related stories",malayalam

കണ്ണൂർ > നമ്മുടെ നാട് എത്തിനിൽക്കുന്ന ദുരവസ്ഥയാണ് ജമ്മുകശ്മീരിലെ കത്വവയിലും ഉത്തർപ്രദേശിലെ ഉന്നാവയിലും കണ്ടതെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയൻ പറഞ്ഞു. വാരം പുറത്തീൽ ന്യൂ മാപ്പിള യുപി സ്‌കൂളിൽ പൊതുവിദ്യാഭ്യാസ യജ്ഞത്തിന്റെ ഭാഗമായി പൂർത്തിയാക്കിയ പദ്ധതികളുടെ ഉദ്ഘാടനം നിർവഹിച്ച് സംസാരിക്കുകയായിരുന്നു അദ്ദേഹം. ജമ്മുകശ്മീരിൽ ബലാത്സംഗത്തിനിരയായി കൊല്ലപ്പെട്ട എട്ടു വയസുകാരി അസിഫക്ക് ആദരാഞ്ജലിയർപ്പിച്ച്ആരംഭിച്ച ചടങ്ങിൽ വികാരാധീനനായാണ് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി ഇക്കാര്യം പറഞ്ഞത്. മനസ്സിനെ വേദനിപ്പിക്കുന്ന സംഭവം ഇവിടെ ഓർമിപ്പിച്ചതുകൊണ്ടുമാത്രമാണ് താൻ ഇക്കാര്യം പറയുന്നതെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു. ആ കുഞ്ഞ് കാമഭ്രാന്തരുടെ വെറിക്കിരയായതല്ല; വർഗീയ ഭ്രാന്തന്മാരുടെ അക്രമത്തിനിരയായതാണ്. രാജ്യം എത്രത്തോളം അപകടത്തിലേക്ക് പോകുന്നുവെന്നതിന്റ ദൃഷ്ടാന്തമാണ് രണ്ട് സംഭവങ്ങളും. ജമ്മുവിലെ അസിഫയുടെ കുടുംബം അക്രമം നടന്ന പ്രദേശത്ത് ഭൂമി വിലയ്ക്ക് വാങ്ങി താമസിക്കുകയായിരുന്നു. അവിടെയുണ്ടായിരുന്ന വിഭാഗത്തിന് അതിഷ്ടമായില്ല. അതിനെ തുടർന്നാണ് ഭീഷണിയും ഞെട്ടിക്കുന്ന സംഭവവുമുണ്ടായത്. കെട്ടിടത്തിൽ അടച്ചിട്ടു ബലാത്സംഗം ചെയ്ത് കൊലപ്പെടുത്തി. വർഗീയ ഭ്രാന്തിന്റെ ഭാഗമായുള്ള അക്രമമാണത്. ജമ്മുകശ്മീരിൽ ബിജെപിയടക്കമുള്ള കൂട്ടുമന്ത്രിസഭയാണ് ഭരിക്കുന്നത്. രണ്ട് മന്ത്രിമാർ കൊലയാളികളെ രക്ഷിക്കാൻ പരസ്യമായി രംഗത്തുവന്നുവെന്നത് നമ്മുടെ രാജ്യം എങ്ങോട്ടുപോകുന്നുവെന്ന് വ്യക്തമാക്കുന്നു. ഉത്തർപ്രദേശിൽ ബിജെപി മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി യോഗി ആദിത്യനാഥിന്റെ അടുത്ത അനുയായിയും നിയമസഭാ അംഗവുമായ ബിജെപി നേതാവാണ് പാവപ്പെട്ട പെൺകുട്ടിയെ ബലാത്സംഗം ചെയ്തത്. കുടുംബം പരാതി നൽകിയിട്ടും നടപടിയുണ്ടായില്ല. നാളുകൾ ഏറെ കഴിഞ്ഞിട്ടും നടപടിയുണ്ടാകാത്തതിനെ തുടർന്നാണ് പെൺകുട്ടിയും കുടുംബവും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുടെ വീട്ടിലേക്ക് വരുന്നത്. ഇതിലും ഭേദം മരണമാണെന്ന് നിശ്ചയിച്ചാണ് ആത്മഹത്യക്ക് ശ്രമിച്ചത്. കുട്ടിയുടെ പിതാവിനെ കസ്റ്റഡിയിലെടുത്തു. പൊലീസും സംഘപരിവാരങ്ങളും അച്ഛനോട് മകളെ പിന്തിരിപ്പിക്കാനും കേസില്ലെന്ന് എഴുതിനൽകാനും ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടു. എന്നാൽ മകളെ പീഡിപ്പിച്ചവർക്ക് മാപ്പ് നൽകാൻ ആ പിതാവ് തയ്യാറായില്ല. പൊലീസും സംഘപരിവാരങ്ങളും എംഎൽഎയുടെ സഹോദരനും ചേർന്ന് പിതാവിനെ തല്ലിക്കൊന്നു. രണ്ട് സംഭവങ്ങളിലും നാം കണ്ടത് ഒരേ വിഭാഗത്തിന്റെ മുഷ്‌കാണ്. ഇതിനെതിരെ മതനിരപേക്ഷതയിൽ വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നവർ രംഗത്തുവരുന്നുവെന്നത് നല്ല കാര്യമാണെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു. പി കെ ശ്രീമതി എംപി അധ്യക്ഷയായി.

Post Views: 289 

Four people including three in a family who are believed to have joined terror outfit Islamic State in Afghanistan, are reported to have been killed in a bomb attack. 
A police intelligence officer in Kasargode, the district from where several people have joined IS, told IANS that they have heard the news but there is no official confirmation from the National Investigation Agency (NIA). 
“What we have come to know is that the dead include Shihaz, his wife and their child besides another man. We are awaiting more details,” said the official who did not wish to be identified. 
Meanwhile, Superintendent of Police KG Simon told TNM that they had got information about the deaths a couple of days ago. “We have not received any official confirmation regarding this,” he said. State Police Chief Loknath Behera’s office also said that there is no official confirmation in connection with it. 
With this, the total number of Keralites, killed after joining IS in Afghanistan, has gone up to eight after the NIA last year confirmed the death of four. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the Assembly in 2016 said that 21 people, including children, were missing from the state — 17 persons from Kasargode and four from Palakkad. 
Recently, Yasmin Mohammed Shaheed accused of recruiting 15 people from Kasargode for IS was convicted for seven years by the NIA special court in Kochi. 
This was the first Islamic State related case in the state in which the trial was completed, an accused is convicted. 
Yasmin is the second wife of Abul Rashid Abdullah who is allegedly the mastermind behind recruiting people from Kerala for IS. The NIA suspects that Adbullah is still in Afghanistan. 
Yasmin and her son were arrested at the Delhi airport in August 2016 while they were trying to go to Afghanistan. Source : ",english

Anil Radhakrishnan,"New lifeline, new promises","April 14, 2018 23:28  00 IST more-in The 633-km West Coast Canal traversing through 11 districts of the State is to be developed, leading to decongestion of roads, reduction of accidents, making cargo movement cheaper and facilitating backwater tourism 
To the ordinary eyes, they are drains that carry urban waste. In most parts, they are covered with invasive weeds. They extend from one part of the State to the other, merging with the backwater system at some places and meandering through the coastal terrain as a canal at others. 
At many places, weeds hide the water below. And where the water is visible, it is mostly oily with all kinds of waste material thrown in. In the thickly populated coastal areas, the sewage pipes from mostly squatter homes abutting them empty into the canals, leaving the flora and fauna underneath gasping for breath. Nothing short of magic can transform these water courses to their pristine glory. If all goes according to plans of the State government, that magic might well become a reality in a few years from now. Once that happens, the canal system would become the pride of Kerala, the State’s link   network. 
In the seven decades since Independence, planners had failed to exploit the enormous potential of inland water transport as a fuel-efficient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. Like the rest of the country, Kerala, with a network of canal system of 1,687 km has also not been able to develop the inland waterways to divert at least a part of the cargo now being transported through road corridors. 
Had it done so, it could have decongested the carriageways of the State’s road network, reduced road accidents that snatch around 4,000 lives annually and bring down the burgeoning transportation and fuel costs. In hindsight, it would appear that planners and administrators of the pre-Independence era were visionaries and had today’s much touted multi-modal transport options in their mind. The West Coast Canal (WCC), which would be the spine of the National Waterways project, was conceived and executed thus. 
Although many plans were set rolling decades ago, steps to dredge and widen the canals, protect their banks, improve the vertical and horizontal clearance of the bridges and foot over bridges dotting all along their length, remove and relocate fishing nets and stakes along the canals to Class III standards of National Waterway (NW) still remain incomplete. Basic infrastructure such as modern terminals, jetties and navigation aids are yet to fall in place. Fiscal incentives for vessel building, loans at concessional interest rates and subsidy for cargo movement through waterways announced by successive governments too have not yielded the desired results. The only silver lining in this dismal scenario is the emergence of backwater tourism with the launch of the houseboats, the floating mascots of Kerala Tourism. 
Of the 633-km West Coast Canal (WCC), the main arterial waterway in the State traversing through 11 districts, only the 168-km Kollam-Kottapuram stretch, including the 37-km Udyogamandal and Champakara canals, declared as NW III way back in 1993 and developed by Inland   (IWAI), is navigable. The next 160-km stretch from Kottapuram to Kozhikode, declared as NW III under the the National Waterway Act 2016, is partially navigable. The 40.08-km Kozhikode-Vadakara and the 58.10-km from Akkulam in Thiruvananthapuram district to Kollam, under the State Waterways, are the other two partially navigable stretches. Encroachments, shallow depth, narrow width, discharge of sewage from houses dotting the banks, dumping of waste, mushrooming of water hyacinth and lack of basic infrastructure facilities continue to haunt the development of the remaining seven stretches of WCC. 
Development of the National Waterway was one of the key promises of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) during elections and, in keeping with the promise, the government has been putting its heart and soul into the project, with the objective of creating inland waterways and feeder routes, port hinterland connectivity and high speed ferries. Although little has been spoken or written about it, an ambitious ₹2,300 crore project to make the 633-km WCC from Kovalam to Kasaragod navigable by May 2020 according to NW specifications is moving at a fast clip now. 
Pushing the ambitious project hard is Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who has mandated shifting of at least 5% of the cargo that move by roads now to the waterway in five years. 
Once developed, the waterway would have a width of 40 metres, initially facilitating movement of turbulence-free boats that can move even at a depth of 4 metres. The proposal is to deploy indigenously developed solar boats on a pilot basis in the waterway. Funds for development of the waterways is being mobilised through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). For time-bound development of the inland waterways, including the uncut portions to be connected along the canal system to the WCC, a joint venture company has been formed by the State government and the Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) on a 49:49 equity ratio, the remaining 2% share going to others. The Chief Minister is the Chairman and CIAL managing director V.J. Kurian the Managing Director of the newly formed Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for Kerala Waterways and Infrastructure Development Ltd (KWIL). 
“The idea is to rejuvenate and ensure connectivity of the waterway from Kovalam to Kasaragod in Phase One,” says Mr. Kurian. 
In Phase Two, scheduled for completion in May 2022, the greenfield works linked to infrastructure development, including the construction of new 12 metre wide and 7 metre high tunnels parallel to the existing tunnels at Varkala, would be taken up. The existing tunnels will be turned heritage monuments. Land acquisition for development of roads of 10 metres on both sides of the canals for creating ancillary facilities would be initiated in the second phase. Tourism villages would be developed along the banks of the developed waterways at every 25 km distance. Water sports activities and geo-cultural centres linked to the culture, heritage and other unique aspects of each area are proposed to be created in Phase Three, scheduled for completion in May 2025. 
Within six months of its incorporation, the KWIL has begun steps for rejuvenation of the 18.5-km stretch from Kovalam to Akkulam that includes the Parvathy Puthanar. Tenders for the work have already been floated. The works are to be carried out with funding of ₹150 crore from KIIFB. Of the 74.18-km waterway from Kovalam to Kollam, only 27.50-km is navigable and 11.30 km partially navigable now. Apart from dredging and cleaning, three new bridges including those at Vallakadavu, Puthenpalam, reconstruction of all cross structures with dimensions lower than 5 metre horizontal clearance and 3.7 metre vertical clearance would be taken up. Rehabilitation of families who have encroached upon the canal, removal of sewage opening into the Paravathy Puthanar and their linking to the Muttathara sewage treatment plant would also be taken up subsequently in a phased manner. 
As many as 1,500 families would have to be rehabilitated in the stretch according to a survey carried out by the Thiruvananthapuram district administration. 
Houses would be be provided to them under the Life Mission. In all, 50 new bridges would have to be constructed along the WCC from Kovalam to Kasaragod. Among the other stretches, the KWIL has found the 26-km uncut portion forming part of the 57-km Mahe-Valapattnam corridor to be the biggest challenge. An artificial link canal with a 60-metre wide corridor would have to be built to connect the Mahe and Valapattnam rivers. The KWIL is involving the Coastal Shipping and Inland Navigation Department, the State Water Transport Department and the Kerala Shipping and the Inland Navigation Corporation in the development of the waterways. The government is of the view that 30 to 60% of cargo being transported through the roads at present and movement of petroleum products, especially hazardous materials like LPG, can be shifted to the waterways, Mr. Kurain said. 
“The State should also take steps to get the entire WCC declared as National Waterway, extend it to Colachel in Tamil Nadu and secure full funding from the Centre for the development of inland waterways rather than mobilising its own resources,” says R.M. Nair, former member (technical), Inland Waterway Authority of India (IWAI). Once the National Water Three, extending from Kovalam to Kollam and Kottapuram to Kasaragod becomes a reality, what Mr. Nair envisages might become possible: the creation of an inter-State tidal waterway that covers a distance of over 700 km, parallel to Kerala’s long coastline and its existing railway track and the upcoming coastal highway.",english

Mr. Vijayan also gave instructions to the Minimum Wages Advisory Board to issue the final notification in a time-bound manner. But hospital managements moved the High Court arguing that the Chief Minister was acting unilaterally. This case was dismissed later.

AN unusual gathering of finance ministers from South Indian states demanded the centre to change the terms of reference of the 15th finance commission which is expected to lessen the powers of the states. The meeting held on April 10, at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala has decided to prepare a memorandum on this regard. The five ministers will again meet at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh to finalise the draft of the memorandum and invitation will be sent to finance ministers of other states too. Yanamala Ramakrishnudu offered to host this meeting at Vizag in his state and this meeting which is expected to be held in the first week of next month would discuss on the possibilities to submit a memorandum to the president of India. Legal possibilities to challenge the centre’s move to diminish the powers of the states will also be explored, Thomas Isaac, finance minister of Kerala informed in a press conference. 
The meeting decided to strongly oppose the imbalance in the distribution of finance commission awards. Centre should not impose condition on states’ rights to obtain loans. Centre must fix grants while states take up centre’s schemes. Incentives in place of grants are not acceptable. Centre’s proposal to allot states share on the basis 2011 census will be withdrawn. The basic criterion for this should be 1971 Census. 
Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation is assigned to prepare a draft of memorandum on the basis of matters of common interest of the participants of the meeting. The meeting was inaugurated by Pinarayi Vijayan, chief minister of Kerala. T M Thomas Isaac presided over. Puducherry chief minister and finance minister V Narayana Swami, Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Karnataka Minister Krishna Baire Gouda, Kerala’s opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala have attended the meeting. 
Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that it is essential to have a struggle with the centre to protect the states’ rights. Centre should accept the opinion of the states. It must withdraw its unilateral decisions on the 15th finance commission’s terms of reference. The right to decide on this should be entrusted upon finance commission itself. 
The concerns regarding the terms of reference should not be seen through a political angle. Protection of the states’ rights is important. These terms of reference will cause huge loss to almost all states. This is anti-constitutional. The effected states should stand united, he said.",english

West Bengal was lost ages ago. In Kerala the last vestiges of the Marxist state are battling religious revivalist forces. Today, one hundred years after the October Revolution, the world has negligible spheres of Marxist influence. North Korea has an absolute dictator who calls his country communist. China today is decidedly capitalist, no matter what they call their political system. Xi Jinping has installed himself in power for life. In Russia Putin has done more or less the same by getting himself elected for a fourth term. In Cuba Raul Castro has taken over from his brother Fidel. Vietnam and Laos are seemingly communist. Marxism, a unique politico-economic philosophy, has influenced the world for a century and a half. The 1917 Russian Revolution was the crowning glory of Marxist endeavour. Satellite nations congregated under the communist banner to form the mighty Soviet bloc. The ideology spread like wildfire through Eastern Europe, Central Asia, China, Cuba and pockets in India, Africa and South America. Che Guevara won the hearts of idealists around the world. Lenin, Mao and Fidel Castro became legends. But before the twentieth century had ended the bubble had burst, the Berlin wall had come down, the Soviet Union had disintegrated, and socialist nations seemed to have given up on the communist ideal.
The story of communism in Kerala is a little different. A communist government came to power in a silent non-violent revolution in 1957. Prime Minister Nehru sacked the EMS government in 1959 but the communists soon came back to power with a vengeance and six decades later, a Left coalition is firmly in the saddle. Can the Marxists in West Bengal and Tripura ever hope to regain lost ground? How long will Kerala remain a Left bastion? Can the Left make a significant impact on India's political scene in the coming decades? Are the ideas propounded by Marx and Engels in the 19th century robust enough to meet the aspirations of 21st century youth? Or does Marxism need remodelling to cope with modern day challenges?
A Place for God
Here in God's Own Country we believe Marxism is still a force to reckon with. Oops! That was a faux pas! There's no space for poor old God in Marxland. Marx castigated religion calling it 'the opium of the people' - and millions believed him. When the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, God was given an unceremonious burial and atheism acquired cult status. But God refused to wither away. In course of time religious resurgence occurred in many parts of the world and the impact was felt even in our tiny coastal state. We are left wondering: Was Marx wrong about God? Should Marxist regimes prepare to accommodate God, religion, rituals et al?
The Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat
The Communist Manifesto, authored by Marx and Engels when they were in their late twenties, foresaw the emergence of global markets and massive monopolies. It called for the abolition of child labour and introduction of free education for all. But there were impractical ideas too. It's hard to figure out how the centralization of banking, communications and transport can facilitate the 'withering away' of the state. But that was in 1848. Marx's emphasis on the economic factors in society and his analysis of class conflict had an enormous influence on contemporary thought. His views on the alienation of labour were profound. Engels' brilliant treatise 'The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State' facilitated a better understanding of gender and property relations, division of labour and the emergence of state power. Lenin's proposals in 'The State and Revolution' include democratic elections with the right of recall, zero policing, no official to receive higher pay than a skilled worker, and 'Every cook should be able to be Prime Minister.' Well, India has a tea-boy PM, but sadly, it has nothing to do with the rise of the proletariat.
For Marx, society consisted of socio-economic classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the former controlling the means of production and exploiting the latter for profit. Those wielding economic power control all other institutions in society - the political, the religious and the ideological. This appears to be an inadequate view when we take into account the complexities of our society, where caste, class, gender and a host of other factors determine the human condition. The word 'proletariat' has virtually disappeared from the Marxist lexicon, but 'bourgeois' remains a much-loved swear word. When a Marxist disapproves of someone he calls them 'bourgeois'. (I was repeatedly called that in the past, and these words are my sweet revenge.) But today's Marxists, (at least those in GOC), are all bourgeois. You just need to look at their cell-phones and their cars. God bless the Manik Sarkars of this country! OMG! That's a double faux pas! (I'd better stick to facts.)
Core Values and Ideals
'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.' Fair enough. But how do we go about attaining this lofty ideal? Until homo sapiens learns to eschew greed there will always be conflict. And as long as power and wealth exist they are likely to be are abused. Inquilab Zindabad! Long live the revolution! The theory of violent revolution is an inherent part of Marxist ideology. Fidel Castro earned the wrath of the United States by exporting revolution all over Central and South America - an attempt that eventually cost Che Guevara his life. But times have changed dramatically - and today nobody wants a revolution. 'Inquilab' only serves a sloganeering purpose. Marx and Engels envisaged the withering away of the State, the abolition of private property and the evolution of a classless society. Was this a pipe-dream? Contrary to their expectations the State is staunchly embedded in the life of the individual. Everywhere in the world private property remains sacrosanct, and citizens believe it is the duty of the State to protect their property. This is a perfect conundrum. Class is an ugly reality in every corner of the world - and India has the added ignominy of being in the vice-like grip of a millennia-old caste system.
The Women Question
While understanding the dynamics behind the subordination of women in a patriarchal society, Marxism proposed no remedies or alternative social structures. Did the theorists assume that the ushering in of a classless society would automatically erase all forms of oppression? There is no evidence of gender equity during the few decades of communist rule in the USSR and China. In India, the Marxists had long tenures in West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala, but the situation of women is not really different from that of women in other states. Everywhere in the world women continue to live in subjection. The problem of patriarchy remains unaddressed. One is compelled to recall Engels' words with deep angst: ""The overthrow of mother-right was the world-historic defeat of the female sex.""
Confusion and Clarification
Dialectical materialism is the Marxist paradigm for understanding economic and political processes. Das Kapital can be viewed as an exercise in dialectics. I wonder how many diehard Marxists truly understand dialectical materialism. Will the real communist educators please stand up? Obviously, all is not well with Marxian theory and practice. The dictatorship of the proletariat never happened. All that materialized was the dictatorship of Stalin, Mao and Castro, followed by that of Putin, Xi and Kim. Private property was never abolished, the means of production still remain largely in private hands, the world continues to have a handful of billionaires and billions of paupers, and women still remain subordinate to men. Interestingly, state-sponsored welfare schemes provide a safety valve against the rising up of the proletariat. And democratic processes make revolution redundant.
Marxian ideology empathizes with the toiling masses but it fails to present a viable alternative to the ills of the capitalism. Neither Marx nor Engels foresaw that one day we would have holes in the ozone layer, global warming, nuclear bombs and cyber warfare, not to mention ISIS, Boko Haram and other sundry entities that pose more diabolic threats than poverty and inequality. But failed revolutions do not erode the intrinsic worth of Marxian ideology, or its ultimate purpose, namely, an end to exploitation of the poor by the rich. The time has come for new-age Marxists to come up with new theories, panaceas and action plans to tackle the ills that plague us in the internet era. Why is homo sapiens bent upon self destruction? How do we end war and weapons, preserve mankind as well as other species, protect the environment, manage disasters and enhance the quality of life? How do we create not just comforts and gadgets but liberty and equality, happiness and contentment, peace and goodwill? If Marx and Engels were alive today they'd probably proclaim, ""Comrades of the world unite! Rethink! Remodel! Reinvent! You have nothing to lose but votes.""",english

Speaking at a press meet in Thiruvananthapuram, he alleged that the DGP had no control over the Rural Tiger Force there, and also asked for the removal of the rural SP, A. V. George. Chennithala said that a fair probe could not be expected from the police investigation team.
He pointed out that the argument by the police that Sreejith had sustained injuries before he was taken into custody had turned out to be baseless. He demanded to know how a person who had got injuries in his intestine could survive for three days without any treatment. The Opposition Leader lambasted George who had appointed the Rural Tiger Force, an informal squad comprising AR camp members.
“Who gave the permission to the Rural SP to form the Rural Tiger Force? Sreejith was taken into custody by the squad members who came in mufti. It is really unfortunate that the norms to be observed during the arrest of an individual has not been met in the case of Sreejith,” said Chennithala. He also demanded that George should be transferred. Chennithala alleged that the police arrested those people whose names were listed out by the CPM leadership.
He also pointed out that the accused who attacked Vasudevan’s house there were yet to be caught. Chennithala iterated that for these reasons a CBI probe or a judicial enquiry was needed into the custodial death of Sreejith. He also demanded that the government give Rs 25 lakh solatium to the Sreejith’s family plus government job to his wife. “Sreejith’s is the sixth custodial death after Pinarayi Vijayan government came to power. The CM has lost control over the force,” Chennithala added.",english

“Chief minister took three full days to react to the gory incident. Instead of trying to safeguard police for all its brutalities, the chief minister should take the force to task. Who gave permission to Ernakulam rural SP to run a Rural Tiger Force on his own? There is no legal footing for such a special force under the SP. Nobody believes that state police’s investigation would bring the real culprits before the law. If a CBI investigation is not possible, the government should seek the service of a serving district judge for a judicial inquiry into the custodial death of Sreejith ,” Chennithala said. 

The law and order maintenance system has been terribly eroded due to the politicization of the police force, by the CPM. “Police act only upon the instruction of CPM leadership. They arrest people as per the list given by the party. Experienced officials are side-lined. The special team of Ernakulam SP did not follow the Supreme Court guidelines to be observed by police while taking a person into custody. The formation of the special team itself was against law and there was a standing instruction by the police chief against setting up of such teams. Police have charged murder case against unidentified persons. This is a clear move to save police personnel responsible for the custodial death,” he said. 

The opposition leader said he would giver a letter to the chief minister demanding a CBI/ judicial investigation. 

Chennithala also demanded financial assistance of Rs 25 lakh to the family of Sreejith and asked the LDF government to take steps to provide government job to Sreejith’s wife.",english

പോലീസില്‍ ക്രിമിനലുകള്‍ക്ക് വാഴാന്‍ അവസരം കൊടുക്കുന്നത് ഭരണകൂടം തന്നെ ആണ് എന്നാണ് പരിസ്ഥിതി, സാമൂഹ്യ പ്രവര്‍ത്തകന്‍ ആയ ഹരീഷ് വാസുദേവന്‍ പറയുന്നത്. രൂക്ഷമായ വിമര്‍ശനങ്ങളാണ് ഹരീഷ് വാസദേവന്‍ തന്‍റെ ഫേസ്ബുക്ക് പോസ്റ്റിലൂടെ. ഹരീഷിന്‍റെ ഫേസ്ബുക്ക് പോസ്റ്റ് ഇങ്ങനെയാണ്...

In a response posted on his social media page, the chief minister said what the child had experienced would enrage and move any human being to tears. “Holding the girl in captivity at a temple fanatics then preying on her people’s representatives then occupying the streets in favour of the accused persons. The country hangs its head in shame over such ‘good days’,” he said.
It was not the rape and killing alone that mattered, the reasons that led to such a ghastly incident were also equally important. “The little girl was raped and killed in the name of religion. It shows the dreadful situation in the country under Sangh Parivar rule. Those who use even temples for such acts and the Sangh Parivar forces who support it are leading the nation towards dark ages of brutality. Sangh Parivar is being driven by pseudo love for religion and pseudo nationalism,” he said. Vijayan added that it was time the country woke up and rally for the cause of the hapless girl child.
Meanwhile, BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan petitioned state police chief against the chief minister for revealing the name and photograph of the rape victim over social media platforms.
“It’s not ignorance that prompted the CM to do that. By trying to give a communal tinge to the incident, his real intention has been revealed. BJP has filed a complaint with the DGP against the CM. The crime committed by him could attract imprisonment up to two years,” Rajasekharan said.
He said the stand taken by the Jammu government was exemplary. “Since chargesheet was submitted in 90 days, there is no possibility for the accused persons to get bail,” he said.
Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the attempts by the BJP, Sangh Parivar forces to protect those accused in rape cases were bringing shame to the entire country. Congress on Friday organized meetings across the state in protest against the rapes and killings. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy inaugurated the protest meet at Martyrs’ Square at Palayam here.",english

For more than 6 months, nurses from KVM have been on an indefinite strike demanding for statutory wages and better working conditions. UNA is the union representing the KVM nurses. 
The letter, submitted to the Chief Minister's office in Thiruvanathapuram, was initiated by Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a major nation-wide platform of 21 national networks and organisations committed to the right to health. With presence in almost all states in the country, these networks cover over 1000 organisations. 
Dr. Amit Sengupta, JSA co-convenor said, “the management of KVM has refused the unions call for dialogue, those of the Labour Commissioner, as well as the mediation attempts by the High Court of Kerala. This is a rogue management with no regard for the law.” 
The demands of the workers are that the Kerala State wage revisions of 2013 be fully implemented, statutory benefits paid, statutory work-load hours respected, and the reinstatement of 112 nurses unfairly dismissed for taking part in a peaceful and lawful industrial action. 
“We stand in solidarity with UNA and the workers that have shown incredible determination in this struggle”, said V Narasimhan General Secretary of the All India National Life Insurance Employees Federation. “We salute the strength and commitment of UNA leaders such as Jiji Jacob, UNA KVM unit President, who held a hunger strike in support of the workers struggle.”, he added 
“The long drawn out dispute at KVM is creating immense hardship for workers of the hospital, who are mostly women, as well as the public”, said Dr. Imrana Qadeer, former Professor of public health at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). 
Out of 112 unfairly dismissed workers, 107 are women. 
“The nature of the demands put forth by UNA is to respect the law. This is an issue on which all unions can come together. If the management of KVM cannot agree, the government should intervene”, concluded Qadeer, among the signatories to the letter. 
Groups including National Alliance of People's Movement (NAPM), People's Budget Initiative and Public Services International (PSI) South Asia, have also endorsed the letter. 
The letter calls on the Government to intervene in the affairs of the hospital and “appoint a care-taker management as an interim measure to ensure that the rights of the workers and the public interest is protected.” Also see",english

Daijiworld Media Network 
Kochi, Apr 15: The Kathua rape and murder has sparked an outrage in the country. However in Kerala, it has resulted in a poster war between the CPM and BJP workers. 
Overnight notices popped up on at least 20 people’s gates asking BJP cadres to not enter their premises in Kalamachal in Thiruvananthapuram district. Soon this protest spread to Chengannur in Alappuzha district where the BJP is facing a crucial bypoll. 
""There are young girls in this house. BJP cadre please stay outside the gate,"" read one banner. 
Many such messages in English and Malayalam had hashtags #BalatkariJanataParty and #RapeSevaSangh 
Sources say that CPM’s Students Federation of India was apparently the brain behind the poster campaign. 
However, as soon as the pictures went viral, BJP used the same strategy to retaliate. BJP's handwritten posters varied from CPM state secretary’s statement on army men to the incident where a pregnant woman lost her baby after allegedly being kicked by CPM workers. 
According to sources, the CPM’s top brass asked its party workers to remove such notices after the issue became viral. 
BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan has condemned the Kathua incident. ""The J&K government’s prompt action helped bring the culprits before the law. The society should isolate such persons,"" he said. 
He also lashed at chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for sharing the victim’s picture on his Facebook page and alleged that he is trying to politicize the incident.   Kathua rape and murder: CPM-BJP poster war in Kerala",english

The ritual comprises arranging on platters auspicious articles like seasonal fruits, vegetables, flower, gold and clothes which together form the first sight when the family members wake up to on the Vishu day. Keralites dressed in their traditional attire thronged temples across the state, including the famous Guruvayur and Sabarimala, which witnessed heavy rush of devotees for Vishu darshan. At the Sabarimala hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa, a large number of devotees from neighbouring states also thronged for the Vishu darshan, for which elaborate arrangements had been made.

बता दें कि सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने 20 मार्च को अनुसूचित जाति, अनुसूचित जनजाति (अत्याचार निवारण) अधिनियम-1989 के दुरुपयोग को रोकने को लेकर गाइडलाइन जारी की थीं। यह सुनवाई महाराष्ट्र के एक मामले में हुई थी। ये गाइडलाइंस फौरन लागू हो गई थीं। जिसमें सरकारी कर्मी की तुरंत गिरफ्तारी नहीं होगी। 
सरकारी कर्मचारियों की गिरफ्तारी सिर्फ सक्षम अथॉरिटी की इजाजत से होगी। आम लोगों के लिए एक्ट के तहत आरोपी सरकारी कर्मचारी नहीं हैं, तो उनकी गिरफ्तारी एसएसपी की इजाजत से होगी। अदालतों के लिए अग्रिम जमानत पर मजिस्ट्रेट विचार करेंगे और अपने विवेक से जमानत मंजूर या नामंजूर करेंगे। सुप्रीम कोर्ट के इस फैसले के खिलाफ भारत बंद का आह्वान किया था, जिसमें 12 से ज्यादा लोग मारे गए थे।

പോലിസിലെ മഹാഭൂരിപക്ഷവും മികച്ച പ്രവര്‍ത്തനങ്ങള്‍ നടത്തുമ്പോഴും ചുരുക്കം ചിലരുടെ തെറ്റായ ചെയ്തികള്‍ സേനയുടെ മുഖത്ത് കരിവാരിത്തേക്കുന്ന അവസ്ഥയുണ്ടാക്കുകയാണെന്ന് മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പിണറായി വിജയന്‍. അവര്‍ക്കെതിരേ കൊലക്കുറ്റത്തിനു പോലും കേസെടുക്കേണ്ടി വരുന്ന സ്ഥിതിയാണ്. ജനങ്ങളുടെ അവകാശങ്ങള്‍ ഹനിക്കപ്പെട്ടു കൂടാ എന്നതാണ് സര്‍ക്കാരിന്റെ നിലപാട്. 
പൗരാവകാശങ്ങള്‍ക്കു മേല്‍ കുതിരകയറാന്‍ ആരെയും അനുവദിക്കില്ല. അത്തരക്കാരെ കുറ്റവാളികളുടെ ഗണത്തില്‍പ്പെടുത്തി ശക്തമായ നടപടിയെടുക്കുമെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു. കണ്ണൂര്‍ സിറ്റി പോലിസ് സ്‌റ്റേഷന്‍ പരിധിയില്‍ പൊതുജനപങ്കാളിത്തത്തോടെ സ്ഥാപിച്ച 40 സിസിടിവി കാമറകള്‍, ജില്ലയിലെ പോലിസ് മൊബൈല്‍ പട്രോളിംഗ് വാഹനങ്ങളില്‍ സ്ഥാപിച്ച സിസിടിവി കാമറകള്‍, ട്രാഫിക് ഉദ്യോഗസ്ഥര്‍ക്കുള്ള ബോഡി കാമറകള്‍ എന്നിവ ഉദ്ഘാടനം ചെയ്ത് സംസാരിക്കുകയായിരുന്നു മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി. 
കേസന്വേഷണങ്ങളിലും കുറ്റകൃത്യങ്ങള്‍ തെളിയിക്കുന്നതിലും ആശ്ചര്യകരമായ മികവാണ് കേരള പോലിസ് പ്രകടിപ്പിക്കുന്നത്. പോലിസില്‍ മഹാഭൂരിപക്ഷവും ജനങ്ങളുമായി നല്ല രീതിയില്‍ ഇടപെടുന്നവരാണ്. ക്രമസമാധാന പാലനത്തിനൊപ്പം ജീവകാരുണ്യ പ്രവര്‍ത്തനങ്ങളില്‍ കൂടി പോലിസുകാര്‍ പങ്കാളികളാവുന്ന നിരവധി ഉദാഹരണങ്ങള്‍ ചൂണ്ടിക്കാണിക്കാന്‍ കഴിയും. എന്നാല്‍ അവരില്‍ ഒന്നോ രണ്ടോ പേരുടെ തെറ്റായ ചെയ്തികളാണ് പലപ്പോഴും സമൂഹമധ്യേ എടുത്തുകാണിക്കപ്പെടുന്നത്. 
ശക്തമായ നടപടികളിലൂടെ പോലിസിന്റെ വിശ്വാസ്യത കാത്തുസൂക്ഷിക്കാനാണ് സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ ശ്രമിക്കുന്നത്. തെറ്റുകാരെ ഒരു കാരണവശാലും അംഗീകരിക്കുന്ന പ്രശ്‌നമില്ല. അതേസമയം നിയമപരമായി കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ ചെയ്യുന്ന പോലിസുകാര്‍ക്ക് ആത്മധൈര്യത്തോടെ മുന്നോട്ടുപോവാമെന്നും അവര്‍ക്കുവേണ്ട എല്ലാ പിന്തുണയും സര്‍ക്കാറിന്റെ ഭാഗത്തുനിന്നുണ്ടാകുമെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു. 
ജില്ലയില്‍ ഉല്‍ഘാടനം ചെയ്യപ്പെട്ട ബോഡി കാമറകളുള്‍പ്പെടെയുള്ള സംവിധാനങ്ങള്‍ കുറ്റകൃത്യങ്ങള്‍ തടയുന്നതിലും കുറ്റവാളികളെ കണ്ടെത്തുന്നതിലും സേനയെ സഹായിക്കുന്നതോടൊപ്പം പോലിസിനെ നവീകരിക്കാന്‍ കൂടി ഉപകരിക്കുന്നതാണെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി അഭിപ്രായപ്പെട്ടു. പോലിസിന്റെ സംസാരവും ഇടപെടലുകളും കാമറയില്‍ റെക്കോര്‍ഡ് ചെയ്യപ്പെടും. മര്യാദ ശീലമില്ലാത്തവരെ മര്യാദ ശീലിപ്പിക്കാനും അവ ഉപകരിക്കുമെന്നും മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു. സമൂഹത്തിന്റെ സുരക്ഷ ഉറപ്പാക്കുന്നതില്‍ ജനങ്ങളുടെ പങ്കാളിത്തം ഉറപ്പുവരുത്തുകയാണ് ജനമൈത്രി പോലിസ് സംവിധാനത്തിലൂടെ ലക്ഷ്യമിടുന്നതെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞു.

India, U.K. in talks over education India and the United Kingdom (U.K.) were holding talks to seal an agreement on mutual recognition of educational qualifications, London’s envoy said. Sir Dominic Asquith said that education was a major area of bilateral cooperation between the two sides which was likely to feature in official discussions during the upcoming London visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India’s non-recognition of the one-year masters programmes given by various British universities had been an issue between two sides as these courses are popular among Indian students. One of the factors that had prevented India from recognising the one-year master courses was the fact that several less-reputed educational institutions were also found to be offering such courses, often jeopardising academic prospects of students. India last month signed an agreement on mutual recognition of educational degrees with France, during the visit of President Emmanuel Macron to Delhi. The British envoy observed that ongoing talks between London and Delhi were on the lines of the Indo-France one.

When the Pinarayi Vijayan government first established the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), an autonomous body, in June 2016, a number of public finance experts predicted it would be ""yet another misadventure"" considering Kerala's economy was in the doldrums. But thumbing its nose at the doomsayers, KIIFB has made remarkable progress. Finance minister Thomas Isaac says, ""KIIFB is no wonder cure for our many ills. We introduced it as an experiment to tackle our various development handicaps... and the results have been encouraging."" Isaac says traditional means to source funds would have needed another 20 years to fill the gaps, hence ""the special [purpose] vehicle (SPV) to raise funds and to secure future revenues"" . 
Despite meeting global standards in several social indices, what Kerala lacks is infrastructure. A traffic survey in 2016 revealed that the 550 km from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasargod took 17 hours to cover. This was because new road construction had been at a virtual standstill due to land acquisition issues. Successive governments had baulked at antagonising landowners and religious groups who held large holdings. Result: bottlenecks became the 'norm'. 
When he took charge in May 2016, CM Vijayan had declared that all national highways would be widened to 45 metres, and that he would yield to no pressure. A first step to this-amending the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Act 1999 and create the KIIFB. The government transferred 50 per cent of road tax collections and the fuel cess to it. Besides the Rs 4,270 crore accrued from vehicle tax and fuel cess, the state is also planning public 'bonds' to bring in money. 
But there are hindrances. The land acquisition protests in Keezhattur and Malappuram have the support of opposition parties, and in some areas, the ruling CPI(M) too. But work goes on. KIIFB CEO K.M. Abraham (an ex-chief secretary), says he is focused on ""implementing projects with transparency and in a time-bound manner"". An independent inspection authority has been set up to ensure quality. A boost for the KIIFB-two key projects, the Rs 86.3 crore Vytilla flyover in Kochi and a Rs 105.4 crore expansion of Technocity in Thiruvananthapuram-are on schedule.

The police stations with lockups in Kerala are being brought under round-the-clock CCTV surveillance in the context of a huge increase in cases of custodial deaths and of complaints about brutal torture in custody in the State. 
As many as 471 police stations with lockups will come under CCTV watch by Tuesday if an order issued by State police chief DGP Loknath Behera had issued the other day is implemented as per schedule. Behera had on Saturday instructed the station house officers at these police stations to install CCTV cameras for making their functioning transparent in two days. 
The immediate reason behind the decision to bring police stations with lockups under constant surveillance is the protests that have erupted across the State against the death of Sreejith (26) of Devaswompadam, Varappuzha near Kochi, an accused in a case relating to the suicide of a neighbor, on April 9 while he was in the custody of the Varappuzha police. 
The CCTV surveillance systems are being installed in the police stations under the supervision of the concerned district police chiefs. As per the DGP’s instruction, the CCTV system will be connected with the computer networks in the police stations and copies of the camera grabs will be transferred onto DVDs on a weekly basis for the purpose of archiving. There are a total of 527 police stations in the State – eight of them women’s police stations – and CCTV surveillance systems are already in place at 110 police stations. The State police chief has also issued a directive to introduce advanced camera systems in 279 police stations. The work on this project is expected to be completed within three months. 
The DGP issued the order to put lockups under constant surveillance after the State Home Department came under fire following the custodial death of Sreejith on April 9 less than 24 hours after he was taken into custody by three officers from the Aluva police’s now-disbanded Rural Tiger Force (RTF), who were not in uniform at the time of the act. 
Amidst reports that the detention of Sreejith was a case of mistaken identity as the person actually involved in the case pertaining to the suicide was another Sreejith, his mother and other relatives complained that the officials at the Varappuzha station did not even give him water when he was writhing in pain after being tortured. The three officials from the Rural Tiger Force had no legal authority to take Sreejith, reportedly a BJP sympathizer, into custody particularly as they were not from the local police. Also, they had taken the youth into custody while he was asleep at his house late in the night. Seven police officials, including the three RTF men, have been suspended over the incident. 
The death of Sreejith in custody has become a huge headache for the CPI(M)-led LDF Government as 16 custodial deaths – though not all of them had taken place in police stations – have been reported in the State in the 23 months since the LDF came to power. It has also upset Marxist Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who is holding the Home portfolio. 
However, the DGP’s administrative reforms in the policing system have not succeeded in satisfying the lawyers and rights workers crusading against the police’s tendency to practice third degree methods on detainees. They are of the opinion that CCTV surveillance at police stations will be effective only if the Government foes for an overhauling of the policing system. 
“That a CCTV system is in place will not purify the policing system. The goons in the police will find way to torture their victims even then. CCTV cameras can simply go out of unction. ",english

Our ministry is working closely with the state to ensure better infrastructure across the nation,' Gadkari tweeted after the meeting.Photograph: Kind courtesy @nitin_gadkari/Twitter The American think-tank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, had featured a riveting 'curtain-raiser' to the 2014 general election entitled Does Good Economics Mean Good Politics In India? ( external link ). 
The essay appeared in December 2013 and I'd carefully stored it in my archives, as a fairly prescient analysis of 'a noticeable shift in the voting patterns in India' toward prioritising good economic performance when evaluating incumbent governments. 
Of course, this nascent and uneven shift continues to run into the headwinds of entrenched political culture devolving upon patronage, populism and parochialism and the run-of-the mill Indian politician still believes that good economics does little to help -- and may even harm -- future political prospects. 
The above dialectic playing out in India's electoral politics casts shadows on the raging controversy in Kerala currently over land acquisition measures initiated by the state government for the widening of the national highway passing through Malappuram district in Malabar. 
Unsurprisingly, there is resistance from private landholders. Land is a precious asset for the Malayali -- second only to his daughter. 
Thus, the Opposition parties, including the Congress party, lent support to the agitation by private landholders. (I wonder what Rahul Gandhi thinks of these mofussil leaders with tunnel vision.) 
What complicates the situation is also that Malappuram is a Muslim-majority district and 'vote-bank' politics comes into play. 
However, the stunning thing is that Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is adamant that the infrastructure development must be advanced in the long-term interest of the state's economy. 
Curiously, Pinarayi's approach, stressing the imperatives of development, is robustly backed by none other than Union Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari (an erstwhile hugely successful industrialist, RSS follower and former BJP president). I stand next only to Gadkari, one of the few outstanding ministers in the Modi government, in applauding the political courage and vision shown by Pinarayi. 
In the run-up to the Kerala state election in May 2016, Pinarayi and the secretary of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, had taken a 'brainstorming session' with a few of us in Thiruvananthapuram to discuss the priorities of a Communist government, if elected to power. (The writing on the wall was already there that the Left was coasting to victory.) When my turn came, I made a brief intervention, prefacing that my life was largely lived outside Kerala, but certain observations could be relevant drawn from a life spent in as many as 8 countries as a diplomat keenly observing men and mice: The Kerala model of development is unquestionably the proud legacy of Communist governments. However, it must be realised that Kerala's development pattern (largely based on social justice and welfare) has plateaued. Even for sustaining the present model, much more income needs to be generated. It is possible to compare the social formation in Kerala in terms of various indices with where China stood at the time of the launching of reforms by Deng Xiaoping. A base is available to shift gear to rapid economic growth in Kerala. Socialism with Kerala characteristics? There is political imperative as well. The best way of weaning the youth away from the orbit of political violence and obscurantism will be by making them stakeholders in development. Clearly, development orientated toward job creation in large numbers is crucial here. Kerala's salvation lies in Pinarayi's leadership. Pinarayi is a rare strong-willed political personality with deep experience in statecraft and administration who has an established reputation for his grit to take difficult decisions and the tenacity to implement them. Most important, Pinarayi is known to be open to fresh thinking and 'out-of-the-box' ideas. Therefore, the next Communist government under Pinarayi's leadership will be well placed to push for a breakthrough in Kerala's development and launch the economy on a higher trajectory of growth. The welfare system provides the underpinning to shift gear. But I came away feeling throughly disheartened because no one else picked up my hypothesis and I had an uneasy feeling of having been heretical in a gathering of leftist thinkers. 
However, Pinarayi's forceful leadership on infrastructure development in the state seems a game changer. 
Of course, the widening of a national highway is not a big deal, but in the Kerala context, it can be a defining moment. The point is, the world is changing and India (and Kerala) cannot remain rooted in time. 
The Financial Times published a report on the weekend that the US is backing the proposal for a $13 billion capital increase for the World Bank, and as part of the deal, China will see its voting power in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) rise from 4.45 percent to around 5.7 percent. 
In the classic line of Left politics, the World Bank and the IBRD are despised as agents of Western neo-liberal imperialism. 
And here is China moving into the driver's cabin to navigate the vehicle. 
To my mind, the US is probably gearing up to mainstream China's Belt and Road Initiative. M K Bhadrakumar",english

The government viewed the flash strike of grave nature violating the service rules. 
Government terms doctor' strike against people and against the government. Government has decided to terminate doctors on probation and transfer the striking doctors. 
Kerala government decided to act against striking doctors firmly and single them out by building up social boycott. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan ruled out discussions with the striking government doctors and directed the Health Minister KK Shailaja teacher to act firmly against the government doctors who are on agitation for the last four days. 
The government viewed the flash strike organized by Kerala Government Medical Officers Association of grave nature violating the service rules. The government doctors announced strike after the Health Secretary issued circular extending outpatient hours from 9 am to 6 pm in 170 Primary Health Centers across the sate. 
Government had appointed three doctors and additional para medical staff in these centres before extending the OP hours as part of Aardram Project executed in the state aiming to strengthen the primary health care system. 
""Majority of the doctors welcomed the initiative. But a doctor in Kumaramputthur PHC revolted against the government decision and suspended the Out Patient wing at 1 pm on April 12. Government suspended the doctor and KGMOA declared flash strike in support of the doctor. 
""The government doctors announced flash strike without giving a notice. The strike was motivated and against the poor people of Kerala who is benefitted by the medical support given by government. We will act firm and will not negotiate with the striking doctors,"" Health Minister KK Shailaja teacher told India Today. Around 4,300 government doctors are challenging the government decision and on strike in the state. 
Government has decided to terminate doctors on probation and transfer the striking doctors. Chief Minister Pinarayi termed the strike as anti-people and anti-government.

In his Facebook post, doctor Shahin Sha appealed to doctor's community not to destabilize the dream of providing medical care to the poor. 
Till 2017, PHC is Kerala functioned with single doctors. Pinarayi government decided to provide additional doctors and medical care professionals to provide best medical care facilities in PHCs. Do You Like This Story? 0 ",english

Even as Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan argues for re-framing the terms of reference of the 15th Central Finance Commission, his own government has rejected most of the recommendations of the state finance commission on tax devolution, says the chairman of the state finance commission. 
This comes after the state government delayed the presentation of the State Finance Commission report in the legislative assembly by two years. 
The 5th State Finance Commission of Kerala was set up under the chairmanship of B A Prakash, former professor of economics at the University of Kerala, James Varghese, principal secretary, local self-government department and V K Baby, special secretary finance. 
The commission submitted the first part of its report which dealt with tax devolution to local bodies, including panchayats and municipalities in December 2015. The second part of the report that dealt with other matters was submitted in March 2016. The award period was 5 years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. 
However, “the Kerala government delayed the presentation of the 5th State Finance Commission report in the legislative assembly by two years. The report on action taken with respect to the recommendations of the commission was placed before the Kerala legislative assembly on February 7, 2018. And the recommendations of the 5th State Finance Commission have not been implemented for two years,” said BA Prakash, chairman of the commission. The state has rejected most of the recommendations of the 5th State Finance Commission on the tax devolution front, he added. 
“At one level, the state is questioning the terms of reference of the 15th Central Finance Commission, while on the other, it is not accepting the recommendations of the State Finance Commission,” Prakash said. 
The two most contentious recommendations of the commission are the basis for calculating the amount to be transferred to local bodies through the development fund and the financial year to be taken into consideration for the estimating the share of local bodies. 
The Kerala government devolves resources to local bodies through three channels: A general purpose fund, a maintenance fund and a development fund. The amount transferred via the first two channels is based on the state’s own tax revenue collections, while the latter is based on the plan size. 
Now, the commission has recommended that transfers to local bodies through the development fund should also be based on the state’s own tax revenue. For 2016-17, the commission recommended that 11 per cent of states’ own tax revenue be transferred to the development fund. This was recommended to be increased to 14.5 per cent by 2020-21. Conversations with former Kerala state officials reveal the government was apprehensive about accepting the recommendation since it would lead to a greater fiscal burden on the state during times of stress. According to the Kerala state budget, the state’s fiscal deficit rose to 4.3 per cent in 2016-17, against a budgeted 3.5 per cent. It has managed to bring it down to 3.3 per cent in 2017-18 (revised estimate).
Part of the increase in financial burden can be traced to the state accepting the recommendations of the 10th state pay commission which involved an additional financial commitment of Rs 77 billion, say experts The other area of disagreement was the fiscal year on which the devolution was to be calculated. Previous state finance commissions had recommended that the devolution be based on the state’s own tax revenue numbers that were received two years ago i.e. the devolution for 2018-19 would be worked on the basis of the state's own tax revenue in 2016-17. The commission had rejected this practise and argued the devolution be based on the fiscal year’s estimate for own tax revenue rather than that of two years ago. 
There were differences of opinion on this recommendation as well. A former Kerala government officer told Business Standard that the tax revenue numbers of two years ago are ‘actuals’ and not ‘estimates’. They are audited numbers and more reliable. Thus the government has decided to continue with the practice of taking revenues of two years ago. First Published: Mon, April 16 2018. 01:56 IST",english

Ker docs continue strike, govt warns of action (Eds: Adds more inputs) Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 16 (PTI) Medical services in Kerala remained hit with the indefinite strike by government doctors entering the fourth day today as the CPI(M)-led LDF regime warned of action if the stir was not ended immediately. Health Minister K K Shylaja said the government would hold talks with the doctors only after the strike was called off. Describing the strike as illegal, she warned that the government would be forced to take action against the doctors, who launched the indefinite stir on April 13 protesting the extension of out-patient (OP) time in government hospitals. They are also opposing the suspension of one of their colleagues at a health centre in Palakkad for refusing to attend to work following the increase in OP timings. Secretary of the Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA), spearheading the strike, Dr Jitesh V told PTI that the doctors would not backout from the agitation. The associations state committee meeting is being held in Thiruvananthapuram, which will decide on how to intensify the agitation, he said when asked about health ministers call to probationary doctors to rejoin duty as early as possible. Officials said the services of post-graduate doctors and house surgeons were being used by the government to attend to patients coming to the OPs. Doctors in Medical college hospitals are not taking part in the strike. The strike has hit patients coming to government hospitals and drawn their ire. ""We are coming to government hospitals from far-off places getting into four buses as we cannot afford to go to private hospitals. The strike is not against the government, but against the poor people,"" a patient said. Meanwhile, a 62-year-old tribal woman who had come to the district hospital in Wynad for treatment yesterday, died this morning at her home with her family members alleging proper treatment was not provided due to the strike. CPI(M) workers took out a march to the hospital alleging that the striking doctors were responsible for her death and demanded action. Shylaja told reporters that the government was not for declaring a war with the doctors. ""They have gone on strike without giving notice,"" she said. The only condition was the strike should be withdrawn first, only after which any discussions will be held, the Health Minister told reporters here. ""There was no reason for them to launch the agitation, and denying treatment to patients is unfair,"" she said. She also said probationary doctors should immediately join duty, failing which action would be launched against them. KGMOA should not force them to continue with the strike, she said adding the government will begin collecting from today details of probationers, who were participating in the strike. The minister also said there are about 4,000 doctors in the list of Public Service Commission (PSC) and government had sought details. The doctors attempt was to defeat the governments Ardram Mission which envisages basic facilities to all hospitals in the state and making government hospitals patient-friendly, she said. As part of the mission, primary health centres are being converted to family health centres to provide a comprehensive health facilities to people. The doctors have made it clear that only the casualty wing would function during the strike and in-patient treatment would be provided only till April 18. There would not be any new admissions and only emergency operations would be performed. ? Jitesh said a team of doctors of KGMOA today gave an assurance to Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Health Minister, saying the association was willing for discussion and ready to cooperate with the Ardram mission. ?? Letters in this regard were handed over to the private secretaries of Vijayan and Shylaja, he said. On the death of the woman patient, he said she was suffering from respiratory infection. She was given medicines and sent back home yesterday. She died at her home. ??

Government doctors have withdrawn their four-day-old strike. 
The decision followed talks between Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and leaders of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) here late Monday evening. At the meeting, the KGMOA leaders agreed to offer their services at the outpatient wings of the primary health centres (PHCs) that have been designated as family health centres under the Aardram Mission. On its part, the government assured the doctors that it would ensure the presence of a minimum of three doctors in such centres. Three doctors each have been deployed in the FHCs that are ready to offer their services to the public. Steps would be taken to ensure the same in the remaining centres as well. 
In the FHCs that need to serve a higher number of patients more doctors would be made available through redeployment. 
The meeting also decided to constitute a committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary (Health), which would hold discussions with the KGMOA representatives on all related issues. Ministerial-level talks would also be held in the first week of May. 
Action against doctors who had stayed away from work during the strike period would be waived once they submit their explanation. Rauf A.K., Jithesh V., Joseph Gomez and Shyam Sundar represented the KGMOA at the talks. 
Earlier in the day, in the course of discussions at the Cabinet meeting, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had asked the Health Minister not to given in to the pressure of the doctors and take a stern stand on their demands. 
Meanwhile, the strike paralysed patient care in all government hospitals on Monday even as the doctors seemed to be headed for a climbdown in the face of mounting public protests in various parts of the State and the relentless stand of the government. 
With the KGMOA informing the Health Minister through a letter that they were willing to cooperate with the Aardram Mission and that they would like to discuss and iron out the differences, Mr. Shylaja, called them for discussions late evening on Monday. 
The doctors seemed to be in a hurry to somehow end the strike. The fact that the CPI(M) top brass was set to leave for the CPI(M) Party Congress being held in Hyderabad seems to have been an another imperative forcing the doctors to settle the strike without delay. 
On Monday morning, even though the KGMOA threatened to intensify its strike and even give resignation letters en massee, Ms. Shylaja called the bluff on the organisation when she stated that there would be definite action against the 1,200-odd probationary doctors who are taking part in the strike and that the government had sought the list of eligible candidates for appointment from the PSC. 
The government had been firm in its position right from the beginning that the sudden strike by the KGMOA, without serving any notice on the government, was unjustified and that none of the arguments put forth by the association for its refusal to conduct evening OP clinics in family health centres set up under the Aardram Mission were tenable.",english

Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 16 (PTI) Government doctors in Kerala, who were on an indefinite strike since the past four days, withdrew there stir tonight after discussions with state Health Minister K K Shylaja.
The Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA), which was spearheading the agitation, has agreed to call off the strike and extend out-patient (OP) time in state-run hospitals till 6 pm, the minister said.
They have also agreed to give their full support to the Ardram Mission where three doctors will be appointed in each family health centre, she said.
The minister said alternate arrangements would be made when doctors go on leave and reserve team of doctors would-be prepared.
The Ardram Mission envisages basic facilities to all hospitals in the state and making government health centres patient-friendly.
On the KGMOAs plea to revoke the suspension of a doctor, she said if he submits an apology, the request can be considered.
The government had suspended a doctor at a health centre in Palakkad for refusing to attend work following the increase in OP timings.
The government had this morning hardened its stand, saying action would be taken if the strike is not withdrawn.
Later in the evening, the KGMOA submitted letters to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Heath Minister expressing that they were ready for discussions.
Letters in this regard were handed over to the private secretaries of the Vijayan and Shylaja, shortly, after which the government called the KGMOA for talks.
Earlier in the day, Shylaja had described the strike as illegal and had warned that the government would be forced to take action against the striking doctors.
The doctors had launched the indefinite stir on April 13 protesting the extension of (OP) time in government hospitals.
The services of post-graduate doctors and house surgeons were used by the government to attend to patients coming to the OPs during the stir, officials said.
Doctors in medical college-cum-hospitals were not part of the strike.
In Wynad, family members of a 62-year-old tribal woman, who had come to the district hospital for treatment yesterday and died this morning at her home, alleged proper treatment was not provided due to the strike.
CPI(M) workers had taken out a march to the hospital alleging that the striking doctors were responsible for her death and demanded action.
However, KGMOA, secretary, Dr Jitesh V said she was suffering from a respiratory infection and she was given medicines and sent back home yesterday. She died at her home, he said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The pro-CPM Kerala Secretariat Employees Association (KSEA) has demanded a detailed inquiry into the complaint filed by an attender in connection with the alleged harassment at the hands of a senior IAS officer. The Association said the authorities concerned should examine the charges and take appropriate action against the officer concerned.
The Dalit employee of the Secretariat had complained to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan about the constant harassment he faced from GAD principal secretary Biswanath Sinha. The GAD secretary had refuted the allegations. Mr Sinha had told some regional news channels that the chief minister’s office had not sought any explanation from him on the matter. The KSEA said the move to unilaterally shift the complainant from GAD without the completion of inquiry, was against the principles of natural justice.
The Congress led association submitted a representation to the chief secretary to resolve the issue amicably and redress the grievances of the staff. In his complaint, Devadas had alleged that Sinha makes him remove food waste from his table after lunch, asks him to clean the food waste from his tiffin box and sometimes he sprinkles water on the table and asks him to clean it up.
He also alleged that he was finding it difficult to cope with the stress and humiliation by the IAS officer. He said the officer also had the habit of tearing paper, throwing all around the floor and asking him to clean up the room. On several days, Sinha has made him sit in office for late hours.",english

പോസ്റ്റ്മോര്‍ട്ടം റിപ്പോര്‍ട്ടിന്റെ മൂന്നാമത്തെ പേജിലെ 17, 18 ഖണ്ഡികകളിലായാണ് ഇതു പറയുന്നത്. ശ്രീജിത്തിനെ അറസ്റ്റ് ചെയ്ത ദിവസം മുതല്‍ ഒമ്പതാം തീയതി വരെയുള്ള മൂന്നു ദിവസങ്ങളിലാണ് മര്‍ദ്ദനം നടന്നതെന്നും പോസ്റ്റ്മോര്‍ട്ടം റിപ്പോര്‍ട്ടില്‍ അനുമാനമുണ്ട്. ശരീരത്തില്‍ മുറിവുകളുണ്ടാകാത്ത വിധത്തില്‍ പ്രത്യേക ആയുധം ഉപയോഗിക്കപ്പെട്ടും എന്നാണ് റിപ്പോർട്ടിൽ വ്യക്തമാക്കുന്നത്. ശ്രീജിത്തിന്റെ ശരീരത്തില്‍ 18 ക്ഷതങ്ങള്‍ ഏറ്റിട്ടുള്ളതായി റിപ്പോര്‍ട്ടില്‍ പറയുന്നുണ്ട്. 
ഒരു മെഡിക്കല്‍ ബോര്‍ഡ് രൂപീകരിച്ച് മരണത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് കൂടുതല്‍ അന്വേഷണം നടത്താനും സാധ്യതയുണ്ടെന്നാണ് റിപ്പോർട്ടുകൾ. മര്‍ദ്ദനത്തിന് ഇരയാക്കിയ പോലീസുകാരുടെ മൊഴികളില്‍ വൈരുദ്ധ്യം കണ്ടതിനെ തുടര്‍ന്ന് പോലീസുകാരെ നുണപരിശോധനയ്ക്ക് വിധേയരാക്കാനും സാധ്യതയുണ്ട്. എസ്പിയുടെ സ്‌ക്വാഡും ലോക്കല്‍ പോലീസും നല്‍കുന്ന മൊഴികള്‍ പൊരുത്തപ്പെടാത്ത സാഹചര്യത്തില്‍ മര്‍ദ്ദിച്ച പോലീസുകാരെ കണ്ടെത്താന്‍ ഇതുവരെ അന്വേഷണ സംഘത്തിന് സാധിച്ചിട്ടില്ല. 
കൊല്ലപ്പെട്ട ശ്രീജിത്തിന്റെ രണ്ടു തുടകളിലെ പേശികളിലും ചതവുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ഇവ രണ്ടും ഒരേപോലുള്ളതാണ്. അതുകൊണ്ട് തന്നെ ഉരുട്ടികൊലയാണെന്ന സംശയം ബലപ്പെട്ടുവരികയാണ്. ശ്രീജിത്തിനെ വരാപ്പുഴയിലെ സ്റ്റേഷനില്‍ കൊണ്ടു വന്നപ്പോഴേ അവശനായിരുന്നുവെന്ന് ശ്രീജിത്തിനൊപ്പം സ്റ്റേഷനില്‍ കഴിഞ്ഞിരുന്ന വിജു എന്നയാള്‍ പറഞ്ഞതായി മാതൃഭൂമി ന്യയൂസ് റിപ്പോർട്ട് ചെയ്തിരുന്നു. ശ്രീജിത്തിന്റെ മരണം സിബിഐ അന്വേഷിക്കണമെന്ന ആവശ്യവുമായി കുടുംബവും രംഗത്തെത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ട്.",malayalam

The Kerala Government Medical Officers Association ( KGMOA ), which was spearheading the agitation, has agreed to call off the strike and extend out-patient (OP) time in state-run hospitals till 6 pm, the minister said.
They have also agreed to give their full support to the 'Ardram Mission' where three doctors will be appointed in each family health centre, she said.
The minister said alternate arrangements would be made when doctors go on leave and reserve team of doctors would-be prepared.
The 'Ardram Mission' envisages basic facilities to all hospitals in the state and making government health centres patient-friendly.
On the KGMOA's plea to revoke the suspension of a doctor, she said if he submits an apology, the request can be considered.
The government had suspended a doctor at a health centre in Palakkad for refusing to attend work following the increase in OP timings.
The government had this morning hardened its stand, saying action would be taken if the strike is not withdrawn.
Later in the evening, the KGMOA submitted letters to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Heath Minister expressing that they were ready for discussions.
Letters in this regard were handed over to the private secretaries of the Vijayan and Shylaja, shortly, after which the government called the KGMOA for talks.
Earlier in the day, Shylaja had described the strike as illegal and had warned that the government would be forced to take action against the striking doctors.
The doctors had launched the indefinite stir on April 13 protesting the extension of (OP) time in government hospitals.
The services of post-graduate doctors and house surgeons were used by the government to attend to patients coming to the OPs during the stir, officials said.
Doctors in medical college-cum-hospitals were not part of the strike.
In Wynad, family members of a 62-year-old tribal woman, who had come to the district hospital for treatment yesterday and died this morning at her home, alleged proper treatment was not provided due to the strike.
CPI(M) workers had taken out a march to the hospital alleging that the striking doctors were responsible for her death and demanded action.
However, KGMOA, secretary, Dr Jitesh V said she was suffering from a respiratory infection and she was given medicines and sent back home yesterday. She died at her home, he said.
The body was brought to the hospital today and the association has suggested that autopsy be performed to find out if there was any negligence.",english

മന്ത്രിസഭയുടെ ഒന്നാം വാർഷികാഘോഷ സമാപനത്തിൽ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി ഇത്തരമൊരു പ്രോഗ്രസ് റിപ്പോർട്ട് അവതരിപ്പിച്ചിരുന്നു. അതേ മാതൃകയിലാണ് ഇത്തവണയും റിപ്പോർട്ട് തയാറാക്കുന്നത്.

Sources in the government said that performance of each department from the day of swearing in (May 25, 2016) to March 31, 2018 will be apprised as part of the exercise. 
A detailed proforma to record performances of each department was handed over to ministers concerned in the cabinet meeting held in the first week of April. 

Along with major achievements, ministers have been asked to rate their performance in plan expenditure. The promises made in LDF’s election manifesto and how far those promises have been fulfilled will be recorded in the proforma. What to do in the next year for achieving the remaining promises is another column in the proforma, said sources. Any other specific project which the department plans to achieve can also be part of the proforma. 

It is learnt that the chief minister has plans to publish a progress report of the government as part of the second anniversary celebrations . This will be done either during the inaugural or during the conclusion of three-week long celebration to mark the second anniversary. “The exercise is only part of compiling a detailed project report,” said a senior official. The CM, however, will not be ranking the performance of ministers, based on the appraisal. 

Sources said a few ministers have already returned the appraisal forms to the CMO while others will complete the formalities in the coming week. Major achievements of the departments under the chief minister –– like home, vigilance and science and technology –– will also be recorded. 

After the CPM party congress beginning in Hyderabad on Wednesday and CPI party congress to be held in Kollam next week, the LDF state committee will formally meet to analyse the performance of the government. There are chances of a minor rejig in the cabinet after the meeting. The CM is not happy with the performance of a few ministers. 

He is also under pressure from the party to bring back E P Jayarajan to the cabinet. A senior minister is learnt to have communicated to the CM his willingness to quit on health ground.",english

The suspension order has been issued by chief secretary Paul Antony on Tuesday, up on the instructions of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The matter has been under the consideration of the government for sometime now, and in the meanwhile, he was suspended for the making inflammatory remarks during the Ockhi disaster. He is presently under suspension pending an inquiry when the government has issued fresh suspension orders in connection with the publishing of the book. The book had remarked about cases that were sub-judice including Pattoor land grab case, appointment case involving former industries minister E P Jayarajan and bar bribery case involving former finance minister and KC (M) leader K M Mani . The government had constituted a committee headed by additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Subrata Biswas and consisting of law secretary B G Hareendranath and former public relations department director K Ampady which examined the service-story titled ‘Sravaukalkkoppam Neenthumbol’. The committee has said that in the book, the officer has made prejudiced comments against the ongoing cases which are in various stages of investigation. The committee had found that his actions violated sections of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, and the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968. As per the section 3(c) of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, no member of a police force should communicate with the press or publish any book letter or other document without the sanction of the Centre unless such a publication is of a purely literary, artistic or scientific character. The penalty prescribed in the act for the violation is an imprisonment of two years, a fine of Rs 2,000 or both. Also, the service conduct rules says that an all-India services officer need not obtain a previous sanction only if the subject matter of the book or contribution is of a purely literary, artistic or scientific character. The committee was constituted on the basis of recommendation by former chief secretary Nalini Netto , who had recommended a detailed evaluation of the book who noted in the file that the book contains pages which cannot be categorised as purely literary or artistic. “There are references regarding political functionaries, statutory bodies like the high court, Lok Ayukta, CBI etc. It appears to be a deviation from a neutral political stand which an all India services officer is expected to take (all India service conduct rules 1968 as amended in 2014)”. The officer had decided to go ahead with the publication of the book without formal clearance from the government. The recommendation was submitted to the chief minister who then removed the charges under sections of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966. The chief minister however retained the disciplinary charges against the officer and ordered his suspension.  ",english

Conferred the Padma Bhushan in 2003, he had been working as a journalist in Delhi for a long time. Hailing from Cherai in Kerala’s Ernakulam district, Shenoy began his career with Indian Express and in 1965, joined the Delhi bureau of Malayala Manorama and served with them for well over a quarter of a century. He was a former Editor of The Week magazine and Sunday Mail and wrote on diverse issues as a columnist. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, while condoling the death of Shenoy, remarked that he was the foremost Malayali journalist in the country. “On account of his five decade professional career happening in Delhi, he was often the ‘ambassador’ of Kerala in Delhi,” he said, adding that while people differed with him on political aspects of his writings, he was always highly-respected by all. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that he has lost an “elder brother” as he, while being an MP, always used to discuss various issues with Shenoy, who was a friend, philosopher and guide to him. “Shenoy was a towering journalist and his loss is going to be a loss for journalism,” he added. 2018-04-18 Veteran journalist T.V.R.

Representational image. Getty images 
Official sources said the board was set up following a request by Special Investigation Team (SIT) chief IGP S Sreejith seeking expert opinion to determine the cause of the death. 
The 26-year-old SR Sreejith was taken into custody for the death of one Vasudevan early this month and died in a private hospital on 9 April. 
His family has alleged he was kicked several times on the stomach and thrashed by police officials. 
The post-mortem report has said Sreejith had died of 'blunt trauma' in the abdomen and there were multiple injuries on his body. 
Meanwhile, the SIT is also probing whether Sreejith was arrested by mistake by the police in connection with Vasudevan's death. 
Vasudevan's son Vineesh had alleged police had mistaken the deceased for another Sreejith whom he had named in his complaint lodged in connection with his father's death. 
Seven policemen have been suspended in connection with the alleged custodial death. 
Opposition Congress has sought a court-monitored probe into the incident. 
Both the Congress and the BJP had demanded that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan give up the Home portfolio.

NEWS / CPI(M) / PARTY CONGRESS 
HYDERABAD: The CPI(M), which leads the Leftist parties at the national level, is through its 22 nd Party Congress, attended by over 700 delegates from various states, at the RTC Convention Centre in Mushirabad here. The largest contingents are from Kerala and West Bengal, 175 each. The main item for discussion at the party congress this time is on ways to fight and throw out the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power in Delhi. 
No social issues are generally or prominently discussed at the party congress. They are rather skirted, as the leadership has no interest other than in parliamentary engagements. When the Congress party held power in Delhi, discussions were on how to fight the tricolour party, just as the party's fight now is against the BJP and Modi. 

Keenly watched at the party congress is the stand the party would take on the plea for association with the Congress party to defeat the BJP – a line being pursued by general secretary Sitaram Yechury; and a contrary stand adopted by senior leader and former general secretary Prakash Karat – that there can be no ties with the Congress, as it is pursuing “neo liberal policies” like the BJP. An added accusation against the BJP is that it is a fascist party promoting religious interests and showing hatred to non-Hindus.   
At the core of the “ideological divide” between the two sides is Yechury’s closeness to the Congress leadership, and Karat’s -- and Kerala party's -- dislike of the Congress. The Kerala unit of the party is against any ties with the Congress also as the two are opposed to each other in Kerala. The Bengal unit of the CPI(M) backs the Yechury line. So far, the mediator between the two sides was Tripura leader Manik Sarkar. Since he was ousted from power in Tripura, and is no more the CM, his personal strength, as also the party’s strength in the north-eastern state, has seen large-scale erosion. 
There is a likelihood of the party congress – in specific the central committee of the party – not according a second term to Yechury. He had not been able to stem the rot vis-a-vis the party’s diminishing popularity during his term. Yechury had been elected as secretary at the last party congress, even as the Karat faction in the party had misgivings about Yechury leading the party. But, Yechury managed to get majority support at the CC. This time, whether he continues having as much support in the CC is keenly being watched. 
Senior leader and polit buro member S Ramachandran Pillai from Kerala has crossed the age 80 and is leaving the politburo due to age-restrictions. He will be back in his state to function as the head of a leftist think tank run by the CPI(M). A close associate of Karat, Pillai’s departure from Delhi will be to the former’s disadvantage.   Senior leader and former Kerala chief minister VS Achuthanandan and present chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan are prominent presences at the party Congress alongside Manik Sarkar and West Bengal leaders. 
Yechury is making an all-out bid to get a second term as general secretary. This is also as he is no more a member of the Rajya Sabha. As per the party’s constitution, one can have a maximum of two terms in the upper house of   Parliament. He has already crossed this line. Yechury, a Telugu Brahmin, hopes to draw maximum support from the delegates of the two Telugu states as also the Bengal unit that has been aligned with the Yechury side. A question being discussed among the delegates is, if not Yechury, then who as general secretary? Among the hopefuls is Brinda Karat, polit buro member who in specific enjoys special support from her native state of Bengal. IHN-NN

I t is quite unfortunate that to make her voice heard while bringing the burning issue of casting couch in the film industry to the forefront, an actor had to take the drastic step of stripping off her clothes in front of the Telugu Film Chambers of Commerce. 
The response was swift, and sadly, typical. The Movie Artistes Association (MAA) suspended her membership, and people in the industry and outsiders unleashed brickbats and slurs at the woman for pulling cheap publicity stunts. 
However, what we fail to understand is the lack of a redressal cell that addresses sexual harassment of artists in the field of cinema, due to which the actor had to resort to this measure because there wasn’t any option left for her. 
Interestingly, it was in 2013 when the Supreme Court first broached the issue of sexual harassment at the workplace through the Vishaka Guidelines and formally mandated the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act. 
Yet, only after five years and the public humiliation of an actor, did the Telugu film industry buckle up to instate CASH–Committee against Sexual Harassment. This means that every production house registered with the Telugu film chamber will have to mandatorily set up its own CASH and sexual harassment redressal panel. For representational purposes.

The move came into effect after the actor’s protest, which led the National Human Rights Commission to look into the matter and subsequently serve notices to both the Telangana government and the Union ministry of Information and Broadcasting on April 12, informing them about the absence of a redressal mechanism. 
Last year, it took a harrowing incident—the abduction and molestation of a female actor in Kerala—for a group of women artistes to establish the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) in the Malayalam film industry to make it easier for survivors to report sexual harassment. The formation of such a collective was a first in a country that sees as many as 1,600 films releasing every year. 
Nevertheless, this move was appreciated as it directly addressed a critical issue that is disturbingly prevalent in every regional film industry across India.

Despite the heavily skewed male-female ratio in the film industry and the evident fact that it is a male-dominated arena, WCC’s establishment gave out the right message—that sexual harassment will no longer be tolerated, and perpetrators would indeed be put to task. 
Since its formation, the collective has been working towards addressing many issues. These include gender disparity in salaries, providing reservations for women in technical jobs in government-owned studios, providing government welfare schemes to women in film industry, maternity pay to women who were forced to abstain from work due to pregnancy, child rearing and physical ailments, awards for films that talk about gender equality, and subsidies for production crews that employ a sizable number of women (30 percent). The newly instated committees in the Telugu film chamber can work towards strengthening their authority and start with the introduction of women-centric initiatives modelled on Kerala’s WCC.

However, this would definitely require an objective approach on the committee’s behalf and would also necessitate that they remain uninfluenced by industry bigwigs and most importantly, receive support from the state government. 
Maybe then, one would start seeing more women enter the world of cinema without being marred by the fear of sexual harassment or casting couch issues.

Sources in the government said that performance of each department from the day of swearing in (May 25, 2016) to March 31, 2018 will be apprised as part of the exercise.
A detailed proforma to record performances of each department was handed over to ministers concerned in the cabinet meeting held in the first week of April.
Along with major achievements, ministers have been asked to rate their performance in plan expenditure. The promises made in LDF’s election manifesto and how far those promises have been fulfilled will be recorded in the proforma. What to do in the next year for achieving the remaining promises is another column in the proforma, said sources. Any other specific project which the department plans to achieve can also be part of the proforma.
It is learnt that the chief minister has plans to publish a progress report of the government as part of the second anniversary celebrations . This will be done either during the inaugural or during the conclusion of three-week long celebration to mark the second anniversary. “The exercise is only part of compiling a detailed project report,” said a senior official. The CM, however, will not be ranking the performance of ministers, based on the appraisal.
Sources said a few ministers have already returned the appraisal forms to the CMO while others will complete the formalities in the coming week. Major achievements of the departments under the chief minister –– like home, vigilance and science and technology –– will also be recorded.
After the CPM party congress beginning in Hyderabad on Wednesday and CPI party congress to be held in Kollam next week, the LDF state committee will formally meet to analyse the performance of the government. There are chances of a minor rejig in the cabinet after the meeting. The CM is not happy with the performance of a few ministers.
He is also under pressure from the party to bring back E P Jayarajan to the cabinet. A senior minister is learnt to have communicated to the CM his willingness to quit on health ground.",english

The suspension order has been issued by chief secretary Paul Antony on Tuesday, up on the instructions of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
The matter has been under the consideration of the government for sometime now, and in the meanwhile, he was suspended for the making inflammatory remarks during the Ockhi disaster. He is presently under suspension pending an inquiry when the government has issued fresh suspension orders in connection with the publishing of the book.
The book had remarked about cases that were sub-judice including Pattoor land grab case, appointment case involving former industries minister E P Jayarajan and bar bribery case involving former finance minister and KC (M) leader K M Mani .
The government had constituted a committee headed by additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Subrata Biswas and consisting of law secretary B G Hareendranath and former public relations department director K Ampady which examined the service-story titled ‘Sravaukalkkoppam Neenthumbol’. The committee has said that in the book, the officer has made prejudiced comments against the ongoing cases which are in various stages of investigation.
The committee had found that his actions violated sections of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, and the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968.
As per the section 3(c) of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, no member of a police force should communicate with the press or publish any book letter or other document without the sanction of the Centre unless such a publication is of a purely literary, artistic or scientific character. The penalty prescribed in the act for the violation is an imprisonment of two years, a fine of Rs 2,000 or both. Also, the service conduct rules says that an all-India services officer need not obtain a previous sanction only if the subject matter of the book or contribution is of a purely literary, artistic or scientific character.
The committee was constituted on the basis of recommendation by former chief secretary Nalini Netto , who had recommended a detailed evaluation of the book who noted in the file that the book contains pages which cannot be categorised as purely literary or artistic. “There are references regarding political functionaries, statutory bodies like the high court, Lok Ayukta, CBI etc. It appears to be a deviation from a neutral political stand which an all India services officer is expected to take (all India service conduct rules 1968 as amended in 2014)”. The officer had decided to go ahead with the publication of the book without formal clearance from the government.
The recommendation was submitted to the chief minister who then removed the charges under sections of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966. The chief minister however retained the disciplinary charges against the officer and ordered his suspension.",english

As another young man died in police custody early this week in Kerala, fingers are being pointed at the shortcomings of the Left Front government in disciplining its men in uniform, even as it criticises police atrocities elsewhere in the country, especially the cow belt. B. Sreejith, 26, of Varappuzha in Kochi, died a day after he underwent a major surgery in a private hospital for intestinal injuries he had suffered, allegedly due to police torture. Policemen in mufti had picked him up from home late Friday night following the suicide of a neighbour. Police had booked Sreejith and ten others on charges of abetment to suicide and rioting. The policemen didn’t produce any arrest warrant while hauling him up from bed and kicking him, as his mother and wife pleaded for mercy. According to reports, the youth died shortly after the state Human Rights Commission’s acting chairman P. Mohan Das visited Sreejith at the hospital Monday morning on receipt of a complaint from the victim’s wife about alleged custodial torture by the Varappuzha police. 
“The youth’s wife gave us a statement that she had witnessed policemen torturing her husband and that he was denied food and water and even treatment for two days. There is gross violation of basic human rights,” the Commission said in a statement. The death of Sreejith, father of a three-year-old daughter, at the hands of the police comes days after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had called upon his forces to “behave ideally” while dealing with the public. Inaugurating the delegates’ meeting held as part of the 30the annual state conference of the Kerala Police Officers Association in Kottayam on Thursday, Pinarayi, who also holds the home portfolio, had said, “Behaviour of the police is an important factor. Police should behave well, which is not in the police station alone, but also while dealing with the public all the time.” 
It seems that the Chief Minister’s advice has fallen on deaf ears, as Sreejith has become victim number 13 to die following police brutality after the Left Front came to power less than two years ago. Criminalisation and politicisation of the police force in the state go hand in hand. The state government has prepared a data about its police officers, following instructions from the High Court. As per the data, 1,129 police officers are accused in criminal cases. The figure was 654 in 2015. Another 475 have joined the gang. The accused include officers in the rank of deputy SPs and CIs. Crimes include torture, rape, bribery and dealing in narcotics. No action has been taken against any of these officers and all of them continue to remain in their respective positions. Many of them have found favour with the new political masters. 
A classic case is that of ADGP Tomin J. Thachankary—facing many criminal charges—who was posted at the police headquarters last June to keep a tab on the movements of the then DGP, T.P. Senkumar, who was at loggerheads with the Chief Minister. Responding to a petition moved against Thachankary’s appointment, the Kerala High Curt had issued an interim order to the state government then. The actions of the government had been called into question on the ground people holding high public offices should not have controversial credentials, the court had said. Nothing happened and Thachankary continues to be one of the most favourite of the present government. Most of the policemen found involved in criminal activities become pliable instruments in the hands of their political bosses. Suspension is just eyewash to fool the public. After six months, the suspended officer is quietly given the same post or even a higher one. 
Politicisation of police always gets a pre-eminent position whenever the Left comes to power. Most of the postings in the force are decided by party functionaries of respective areas. Say for example no police officer can continue in his post in volatile Kannur without the consent of CPM’s district secretary. This was not the case during the opposition UDF government. The presence of able and honest police officers during that time had reflected in the fall of political murders in the area. However, things changed with the taking over of the police force by the present DGP, Loknath Behra, who is said to be close to the Chief Minister. During his tenure so far, Kannur has witnessed over a dozen murders. 
Each time something goes wrong, the Chief Minister would be too eager to defend his police chief and the force in the state Assembly. He has done it umpteen times, including lapses on the part of the police in investigating the rape of a prominent film star. It is always others to blame or the constant refrain of party functionaries is that “this is not our policy”. But no one spells out what actually the policy of the Left government is, regarding the functioning of the police force. Initially, the blame was on the “saffronisation” of police force. Now it has shifted to those in uniform out to “discredit the Pinarayi Vijayan government”. 
There are enough indications that the local CPM leadership is trying to cover up the case by just suspending a few officers, while the real culprits get away. Shockingly, the Crime Branch IG’s report says there is no evidence of police torture. Policemen on duty are only accused of denying food and prompt medical facility to a dying Sreejith. Indications are that like all other lock-up murders in the past, inquiry into Sreejith’s murder too will be conducted by the department itself. That will ensure no action against any of those criminals in the force who murdered Sreejith in cold blood.

Addressing the inaugural session, CPI-M General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said mobilizing secular and democratic forces was imperative to strengthen people's struggle for the realization of an alternative policy direction for the country. 
He exuded confidence that the party conclave will give will give a new direction to strengthen its independent activities, to intensify people's struggles, to strengthen unity of Left forces and to boost the unity of the Left and democratic forces. 
Setting the tone for the deliberations at the five-day meet, Yechury said that the BJP government at the Centre had imposed unprecedented miseries on the people and, at the same time, grievously threatened the unity and integrity of the social fabric. 
""The dehumanization of our society is seen in the chilling incidents of rape in Kathua and Unnao. It is shameful to see rape being used as weapon for communal polarization. This must be resisted and defeated,"" he said. 
He said Muslims and Dalits were being targeted for murderous assaults in the name of cow protection. 
""In the name of moral policing our youth are being told what to wear, what to eat, whom to befriend. Those not following such instructions are assaulted. These private armies are seeking to control our social order, under the patronage of RSS/BJP."" 
Yechury identified four challenges which he said need to be confronted with urgency and reversed. 
He said the answer to these challenges was a policy alternative that can only be provided by the Left and democratic forces. 
He told the delegates gathered from across the country that the assault of neo-liberal economic policies had assumed unprecedented dimensions. 
He claimed that the neo-liberal offensive had sharpened extreme inequalities. ""In 2017, 1% of the richest Indians cornered 73% of the wealth generated in our country."" 
He said the deepening agrarian distress was being resisted by peasantry all across the country. 
""The promise to our youth of creating two crore jobs every year has been reneged. On the contrary, even in the organised sector today, there is growing unemployment."" 
He described demonetization and GST as the twin assaults which economically uprooted crores of our people dependent on the cash economy and decimated the small-scale industry which provides the largest employment opportunities outside of agriculture. 
He alleged that in West Bengal the Left was a target of a reactionary and communal combine. 
He said the RSS and BJP were targeting the Left cadres with murderous assaults both in Tripura and Kerala. 
The inaugural session presided over by former Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar was attended by Kerala Chief Minister Pinyari Vijayan, party leader Prakash Karat and leaders of Communist Party of India, Forward Block, Revolutionary Socialist Party and SUCI-C.

The 22nd Congress of the CPI(M) began in Hyderabad on Wednesday with the Left parties calling for a united approach to defeat the BJP in the upcoming elections. 
Freedom fighter and veteran Communist leader Mallu Swarajyam hoisted the party flag marking the beginning of the conference, which was inaugurated by CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury. 
In his inaugural speech, Yechury said the BJP government, controlled by the RSS, is pursuing policies that have imposed misery on the people, while also threatening the unity and integrity of the country’s social fabric. 
“The dehumanisation of our society is seen in the chilling incidents of rape in Kathua and Unnao recently. It is shameful to see rape being used as weapon for communal polarisation. This must be resisted and defeated,” he said. 
‘A new direction’ 
Yechury said the conference will give a new direction to the CPI(M). It will strengthen the party’s independent efforts at intensifying people’s struggles and political interventions. It was also aimed at strengthening the unity of the Left forces, he said. Yechury added that the answer to the country’s challenges is the policy alternative that can only be provided by the Left and democratic forces. 
“The assault of neo-liberal economic policies has assumed unprecedented dimensions. The sharpening of communal polarisation is tearing asunder the unity of our social fabric as never before. The assaults on institutions of parliamentary democracy and constitutional authorities have unleashed an anti-democratic onslaught and India has been reduced to the status of a junior partner and a subordinate ally of US imperialism,” he said. 
CPI General Secretary S Sudhakar Reddy, who was also present at the conclave, said the Modi government had brought disaster to the nation, with “naked communalism, intolerance, pro-corporate, anti-people economic policies and tilting the independent foreign policy towards US, Isreal and other such forces”. “Modi government is authoritarian, dictatorial and leading to fascist take over. RSS with its fascistic ideology is in direct control of Modi government, which is turning to be fascistic. Hence Left needs to unleash more massive and militant struggle to bring relief to different sections of people in the country and counter the fascistic offensive,” he added. 
CPI(ML-Liberation) General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said the focus of the Left must also be on the extra-parliamentary struggles to resist and defeat fascism. Published on",english

Will there be a Yechury-Vijayan showdown at 22nd CPI-M party Congress? — By Sanu George Thiruvananthapuram/ IANS | Apr 18, 2018 03:55 pm FOLLOW US: Having won the first round in the battle for supremacy in the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is unlikely let slip his advantage as he takes on party General Secretary Sitaram Yechury at the 22nd party Congress, which began in Hyderabad on Wednesday. The first round was won by Vijayan in January this year at a Central Committee meeting of the party in Delhi. He had then led the group of 55 members who voted in favour of former General Secretary Prakash Karat’s position that the CPI-M should not have any electoral truck with the Congress party. Only 31 voted against the move, which incidentally was the line of Yechury, a strong votary of an alliance with the Congress. And since then, the already-sour relationship between the two has taken a nosedive. The battle between the two can be traced back to the 21st CPI-M party Congress held at Visakhapatnam in 2015. While Vijayan and his faction wanted S. Ramachandran Pillai, the veteran party leader from Kerala, to become the General Secretary, things did not quite go the way he wished, paving the way for Yechury’s elevation as Karat’s successor. Three years down the line, Vijayan has virtually the entire party firmly in his grip. His long-time foe in the state, former chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, is keeping a very low profile on account of his age and many supporters deserting him. An overwhelming majority of the 175-strong delegation of party members from Kerala is likely to do Vijayan’s bidding if the need arises at the five-day Congress, which concludes with a public rally in Hyderabad on the April 22. In all, 780 delegates with voting rights will be attending the Congress and Kerala, with 175, has the largest contingent, followed by West Bengal with 165. With the Central Committee already showing its allegiance to Vijayan in January, party insiders say that, should there be a contest to elect the next General Secretary, it could mean curtains for Yechury. A top source in the party told IANS that given the present state of affairs in the CPI-M — a party that is not in the best of health, especially after losing its last eastern bastion in Tripura to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — Yechury’s position is somewhat shaky at the moment. “If there is any thinking about making changes at the highest level, Manik Sarkar, the former Tripura chief minister, is seen as the best bet to replace Yechury. Sarkar enjoys the support of Vijayan, besides a sizeable chunk of delegates from West Bengal — which is bad news for Yechury. Share this Post:",english

Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 16 : Government doctors in Kerala , who were on an indefinite strike since the past four days, withdrew there stir tonight after discussions with state Health Minister K K Shylaja . 
The Kerala Government Medical Officers Association ( KGMOA ), which was spearheading the agitation, has agreed to call off the strike and extend out-patient (OP) time in state-run hospitals till 6 pm, the minister said. 
They have also agreed to give their full support to the ‘Ardram Mission’ where three doctors will be appointed in each family health centre, she said. 
The minister said alternate arrangements would be made when doctors go on leave and reserve team of doctors would-be prepared. 
The ‘Ardram Mission’ envisages basic facilities to all hospitals in the state and making government health centres patient-friendly. 
On the KGMOA’s plea to revoke the suspension of a doctor, she said if he submits an apology, the request can be considered. 
The government had suspended a doctor at a health centre in Palakkad for refusing to attend work following the increase in OP timings. 
The government had this morning hardened its stand, saying action would be taken if the strike is not withdrawn. 
Later in the evening, the KGMOA submitted letters to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Heath Minister expressing that they were ready for discussions. 
Letters in this regard were handed over to the private secretaries of the Vijayan and Shylaja, shortly, after which the government called the KGMOA for talks. 
Earlier in the day, Shylaja had described the strike as illegal and had warned that the government would be forced to take action against the striking doctors. 
The doctors had launched the indefinite stir on April 13 protesting the extension of (OP) time in government hospitals. 
The services of post-graduate doctors and house surgeons were used by the government to attend to patients coming to the OPs during the stir, officials said.
Doctors in medical college-cum-hospitals were not part of the strike. 
In Wynad, family members of a 62-year-old tribal woman, who had come to the district hospital for treatment yesterday and died this morning at her home, alleged proper treatment was not provided due to the strike. 
CPI(M) workers had taken out a march to the hospital alleging that the striking doctors were responsible for her death and demanded action. 
However, KGMOA, secretary, Dr Jitesh V said she was suffering from a respiratory infection and she was given medicines and sent back home yesterday. She died at her home, he said. 
The body was brought to the hospital today and the association has suggested that autopsy be performed to find out if there was any negligence. 
The Kerala Human Rights Commission (KHRC) had also asked the government to take immediate steps to resolve the issue as it was the common people who were facing hardships. UD ANB ANB

TRIVANDRUM: Police in Kerala have arrested 1,102 people mainly from northern districts for violently enforcing a shutdown this week.They also registered some 350 cases of vandalism.The shutdown call originated from unidentified handles on the social media, and several men took to the streets across the state attacking shops and vehicles.They came out without any banners or flags as political parties do and went on a rampage leaving the public with no clue.They were registering their protest against the brutal gang rape and murder of Asifa, an eight-year-old Muslim nomad girl in Indian administered Kashmir.Officials say there was a deliberate attempt to create a communal divide and reap electoral dividends by stoking religious sentiments.The southern state, dubbed as India’s tourism gem, had witnessed 33 shutdowns this year, including those enforced by ruling parties, and seven of them this month alone.But Monday’s protest perplexed the police as nobody had owned it up, though many shared the call, which reportedly came from a proxy server, on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.The state’s Human Rights Commission directed the police to deal with the perpetrators sternly and book them under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.It directed the police chief to file a report on the action taken within 30 days.“There was an attempt to divide people and communalise a sensitive issue. They all should go behind bars,” SHRC chair P Mohana Das said.“If the police do not act tough, such incidents will repeat.”The opposition Congress party accused chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan of doing nothing despite receiving an intelligence report that warned of widespread violence.Its vital ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) also condemned the violence in the name of the little girl raped and killed by eight men during six days of her captivity in a temple.Senior leader Aryadan Mohammed said fringe groups of extremists like Welfare Party of India (WPI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) were behind the attacks. “Those organisations which are exploring how to unleash violence and create communal riots in the country were behind them,” he said in Malappuram.",english

CPI(M)-led LDF government in Kerala is to come out with a progress report on its achievements on the completion of second year in office next month, official sources said. All departments under various Ministers, including that held by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, would be subjected to a self-appraisal on the funds spent and schemes implemented to finalise the report, the sources said. 
In addition to the developmental activities undertaken so far by each department and progress made in fund utilisation, details on the progress in activities of the departments have also been sought in a special form issued by the general Administration Department, they said. 
Most of the departments have reported back, sources said. It was stated in the LDF manifesto that every year the government’s activities would be evaluated and future programmes would be organised by interacting with the public based on the report. The progress report would mention the government’s performance vis-a-vis each of the promises made in the election manifesto, they said. 
Experts and the general public would be able to make their independent assessment based on the evaluation, they added. The government had released its first progress report on its achievements in June 2017, they said. For all the latest India News , download Indian Express App More Related News ",english

New Delhi, 19th April, 2018: Kerala state police has arrested around thousand people who protested on Asifa issue. People arrested are on non-bailable charges. It is a shame. The reason is that the protest was initiated by the Muslim groups. Violence was also stated as a reason. Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister of Kerala (A member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of India, Marxist) must remember that much bigger violence was initiated by left organisations in the past. Even the Congress government did not behave in the same manner on the left on such occasions. If the victim is a Muslim, the Muslims have every right to protest. You can take action on those who conducted violence. But not on Muslims in general who protested. That will become a communal action by the LDF. Secondly, There is a basic confusion for many people. One should first understand that women through their gender identity as well as sexual identity are marginalised. Gender is a social construct. Sex is a biological construct. Both are power dynamics of patriarchy. However, both these identities have multiple marginalisation when it is combined with caste, minority religion, nationality, race, or any marginalised culture. A dalit woman can be raped not just for being a woman, but for being a dalit as well. In Kandhamal and Gujarat, women were raped not just for being women, but for being Christians or Muslims. In fact, the rapists have even articulated this while raping. Now, if you can’t understand this phenomenon, it is only sheer political ignorance. Please understand that during every war and every communal violence women are targeted not to conquer a woman, but to express power over another community. For they know that men of the other community will be weakened if their women are targeted. Women in Kashmir and North East were raped in large numbers not just for being women, but for being part of a marginalised nationality identity on their bodies. We better understand this reality. This doesn’t mean a justification for the women’s oppression within the minority religions. However, it has to be accepted that women face double or triple or multiple marginaisations depending upon the context of their identities. Going by the LDF logic, Muslims should not have a right to protest on Gujarat genocide and Christians should not have a right to protest on Kandhamal. It is like saying that if the victimised identities protest, it will become communal. Arrest those who indulged in violence. Release all others immediately. TOPICS",english

Having won the first round in the battle for supremacy in the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is unlikely let slip his advantage as he takes on party General Secretary Sitaram Yechury at the 22nd party Congress, which began in Hyderabad on Wednesday. 
The first round was won by Vijayan in January this year at a Central Committee meeting of the party in Delhi. 
He had then led the group of 55 members who voted in favour of former General Secretary Prakash Karat’s position that the CPI-M should not have any electoral truck with the Congress party. Only 31 voted against the move, which incidentally was the line of Yechury, a strong votary of an alliance with the Congress. 
And since then, the already-sour relationship between the two has taken a nosedive. 
The battle between the two can be traced back to the 21st CPI-M party Congress held at Visakhapatnam in 2015. While Vijayan and his faction wanted S. Ramachandran Pillai, the veteran party leader from Kerala, to become the General Secretary, things did not quite go the way he wished, paving the way for Yechury’s elevation as Karat’s successor. 
Three years down the line, Vijayan has virtually the entire party firmly in his grip. His long-time foe in the state, former chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, is keeping a very low profile on account of his age and many supporters deserting him. 
An overwhelming majority of the 175-strong delegation of party members from Kerala is likely to do Vijayan’s bidding if the need arises at the five-day Congress, which concludes with a public rally in Hyderabad on the April 22. 
In all, 780 delegates with voting rights will be attending the Congress and Kerala, with 175, has the largest contingent, followed by West Bengal with 165. 
With the Central Committee already showing its allegiance to Vijayan in January, party insiders say that, should there be a contest to elect the next General Secretary, it could mean curtains for Yechury. 
A top source in the party told IANS that given the present state of affairs in the CPI-M — a party that is not in the best of health, especially after losing its last eastern bastion in Tripura to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — Yechury’s position is somewhat shaky at the moment. 
“If there is any thinking about making changes at the highest level, Manik Sarkar, the former Tripura chief minister, is seen as the best bet to replace Yechury. Sarkar enjoys the support of Vijayan, besides a sizeable chunk of delegates from West Bengal — which is bad news for Yechury. Posted Under",english

An emotional Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday rejected allegations about his “pro-Congress” mindset and told the 22nd party congress that his “only objective is to defeat the BJP.” 
Hours after his predecessor Prakash Karat presented the political resolution in at the congress in a rare departure of norms, Yechury stood up to present what he called “the minority point of view .” 
He insisted that there should be a scope of political understanding with other parties. 
“I am not a Congressman. I am not asking for an alliance with the Congress. There are allegations that I am advocating for Congress. I am not, “ said Yechury, while he appealed for an unified view on the issue of the party’s political-tactical line. 
Karat, who enjoys the majority support, said that electoral politics and the political-tactical line should not be mixed. “This political resolution is for three years but when election comes we will take suitable steps to defeat BJP, “ he said, reminding that in 2004, the Left supported the United Progressive Alliance without any specific mention in the political-tactical line in that regard. 
Two senior leaders from West Bengal, the state which is solidly behind Yechury, said if there is no middle path, there will be voting on the political line on Friday. Casting votes on the political line could be a rare and embarrassing step as it exposes fault lines between the state units. 
In his last ditch effort to push his political line at the party congress, Yechury earlier on Wednesday called for “mobilizing secular democratic forces” to defeat the BJP government. Yechury’s inaugural speech focused on countering the BJP-RSS combination, sparing any mention of the Congress. 
The general secretary wants the CPI(M) to keep the door ajar for a political understanding with the Congress amid hectic parleys in the Opposition camp for an anti-BJP alliance for 2019. The powerful Prakash Karat camp, comprising of states like Kerala, are opposed to any such step. 
Yechury’s line has so far been rejected in the politburo and the Central Committee with an overwhelming majority. The party congress is the last forum for the final debate on this issue and if the general secretary’s proposals gets defeated, Yehcury’s status as the head of the party will be will be under pressure. 
The debate on the political-tactical line started in the afternoon and is expected to continue for the next few days. tags",english

NEWS / CPI(M) / CONGRESS 
UPDATE: FRIDAY: The CPI(M) 22nd party congress in Hyderabad saw consensus emerging between the Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury sides, over the contentious issue of associations with the Congress Party. Both sides yielded ground amid mediation by  Kerala Chief  Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Tripura's former CM, Manik Sarkar. It was decided that a voting on the amendments to the political resolution introduced by Prakash Karat should be avoided; however, later, the fresh set of amendments based on the consensus formula was put to vote and the political resolution passed. There was palpable relief on both sides as the party could present a united face after two days of tough stands by Karat and Yechury sides. 

A majority of states, 16 in all -- most of them zero entities in terms of mass support as also Bengal and Punjab units -- sought secret ballot if a voting was needed. It obliquely meant, they wanted to support Yechury's stand for close ties with the Congress Party. Fact is also that the parties in these states have little relevance or support base and can stand straight only with support from an established set-up like the Congress, if a fight with the BJP is warranted. In most states, under Yechury's tutelage, the CPI(M) is already acting as the B team for the Congress.  

The Karat side took the signal and agreed for compromise proposed by Yechury. The continuation or otherwise of Sitaram Yechury for a second term will be decided and announced on Saturday. Under the present circumstances, he is likely to get one more term. --IHN-NN 
PREVIOUS REPORT 

UPDATE: THURSDAY: Deep divide in CPI(M) over Congress ties. Yechury side favours secret vote to pass amendments to the draft political report, while Karat side insists there cannot be a secret ballot. Yechury addressed a press meet at which he did not rule out a vertical split in the party though he said it was too early to speak on such matters. If there is voting, it could take place Friday afternoon. Yechury said the normal practice is to vote by raising one's hand. Trends from the delegates' participation in the discussions showed the Karat side having an edge. IHN-NN 

HYDERABAD: All eyes are on general secretary Sitaram Yechury as the CPI(M) leaders sat in session for the 22 nd party congress at the RTC Kalyana Mandapam hall for the second day on Thursday. The flag hoisting for the event was held on Tuesday and the event will conclude with a public rally here on April 22. A likelihood of Yechury being replaced at this juncture, when he completes his first term as general secretary, is seen as strong. 
Yechury started his term at the last party congress in Visakhapatnam in 2015, braving odds and what seemed like a vertical divide in the party. 
In the event, two names are in circulation to take up the job: the now-jobless Manik Sarkar, who was ousted from power as chief minister in the recent assembly polls in Tripura, and senior politburo member Brinda Karat. Another senior politburo member S Ramachandran Pillai is in retirement mode as he has reached the age of 80, and would now head back to his home state of Kerala to take up the leadership of a party think tank based in Thiruvananthapuram. 
Prakash Karat who introduced the political resolution for discussion and voting stressed on Wednesday that the central committee and the polit buro had already ruled out any association with the Congress party that is following the “neo-liberal policies” on the lines of the West. Yechury who later presented an alternative line, pitched for joint action alongside the Congress and other non-BJP parties. He made it clear that his aim is to oust the Modi-led BJP government. “To achieve this, Congress’ support is essential,” he said.  
His reasoning: the BJP is a fascist organisation functioning on religious lines. Yechury took pains to explain that he was not holding a brief for the Congress party, as many suspect. Yechury is closely associated with Sonia Gandhi and several other top brass of the tricolour party. 
Delegates from Kerala like P Rajeev who spoke at the meeting said it would be suicidal to have an association with the Congress, as the CPI(M) built its muscles on the plank of anti-Congressism. “We will not be able to explain to the rank and file of the party why we now discard this policy,” he said. 
A voting is likely on the political resolution even as it carried a few hundred amendments proposed from lower levels. If the Karat side wins in the voting, Yechury’s continuation as general secretary is untenable. The Kerala unit of the party has been asked by its secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan to back the Karat line; and the Bengal unit is likely to stand solidly behind the Yechury line. Opinion is divided among delegates from other states, also as the party, or the left as a whole, has no notable support base of independent existence in most states. They are eager thus to ride piggyback on the Congress. Under the circumstances, who will have the last laugh remains to be seen. 
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is strongly backing the Karat line; the state party stands solidly behind Vijayan and Balakrishnan, though a few of the delegates had in the past been seen to be close to Yechury; the state finance minister Thomas Issac, for instance. But, they have no courage to rebel against the official stand of the state party leadership. 
Of the 780 delegates at the party congress, Kerala has brought in over 170 and Bengal a little less than 170. State party leaderships mostly tend to side with the Kerala leadership, of late, as the Bengal party is passing through an existential struggle and the Kerala party is heading the LDF government in the southern state. Karat and Vijayan together seem to hold the upper hand at the party congress, just as they do at the CC and the Polit Buro.  But, Yechury is highly resourceful and, as was proven in the past, has a strong will to have his way.–IHN-NN

United Nurses Association - the largest organisation of nurses employed with private hospitals in Kerala, is again up in arms with the government for not issuing order regarding the pay hike as promised in July 2017. 
The nurses have been staging a symbolic strike in front of the Secretariat since Tuesday. They plan to go for a protest by boycotting work from April 24, if the government fails to issue the order. As the order is yet to be issued, the nurses haven’t received the revised salary based on the consensus reached between them and the government in July 2017. 
“As per the Minimum Wages Act 1948, there are a lot of technical procedures for a pay revision to finally come into effect. In our case, the Minimum Wages Committee has submitted the recommendations to the government. We have given the government ample time to come out with draft notification based on that, but the government hasn’t moved a step forward. By delaying this, the government is trying to sabotage the Supreme Court directive of ensuring minimum wages,” Siby Mukesh State Vice President of UNA told TNM. 
Also, the Committee in its recommendations of pay hike has reduced the allowance which would effectively nullify the pay revision. “In the Committee, there are no representatives of the nurses. Our gross salary is basic pay plus allowance. The committee recommended to reduce allowance of nurses from 10,000 to 8,000 and that of other staff from 6,400 to 4,000. The government should show the determination to do away with these recommendations and come out with notification to implement the salary revision which is favourable for the nurses and which is as per the SC directive,” Siby said. 
The nurses protest in June and July 2017 had paralysed the health sector in the state as the private hospitals were forced to restrict their operations. The strike was spearheaded by UNA, which has as many as one lakh nurses associated with it and the Indian Nurses Association. 
The strike was called off after discussion with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, following the protest that lasted for almost two months. The government had then agreed to hike the basic pay to Rs 20,000. “It has been decided to hike the basic pay of nurses who are working in hospitals with a bed strength of up to 50 to Rs 20,000. The government will appoint a committee to decide on the salary of nurses working in hospitals where the number of beds are more than 50,"" a statement from the Chief Minister's office had said. 
Nurses working in the private sector have been struggling for long to get decent wages. 
In April 2013, the government had reached an agreement with private sector hospitals to revise the pay structure of nurses by 25 to 35% following a series of protests by nurses working in various hospitals. The deal was signed on the basis of recommendations of a committee set up by the government to study the issue. The agreement was that nurses of hospitals having up to 100 beds will get a salary hike of 35%. For those working in hospitals with a capacity of up to 25 beds, they were entitled to get a 25% increase. ",english

KOCHI: A Special Investigation Team probing the alleged custodial death of a 26-year-old man at nearby Varappuzha today arrested three policemen, who were suspended earlier, in connection with the incident. 
""Three policemen, including Jithinraj, Sumesh and Santhosh have been arrested in connection with the incident. They were members of the Rural Tiger Force of Ernakulam rural police"", Special Investigation Team (SIT) chief IGP S Sreejith said. 
He said their arrest was recorded after collecting necessary evidence in the primary investigation. 
""They have been charged under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code"" (punishment for murder), he told reporters outside Aluva Police Club. 
Earlier, the policemen were questioned in the club. 
Assuring justice for Sreejith's family, the SIT chief said the probe would be conducted against those found involved in his death. 
The arrested policemen will be produced before the Court tomorrow. 
The SIT IGP indicated that further action would be taken based on the report five-member medical board to ascertain the real cause of Sreejith's death. 
The Kerala government had set up the medical board to ascertain the real cause of the death after alleged police torture while in custody. 
Official sources said that the board was set up on a request by the SIT IGP, seeking expert opinion to determine the cause of the death. 
Sreejith was taken into custody for the death of one Vasudevan early this month and died in a private hospital on April 9. 
Seven policemen were suspended in connection with the incident. 
Responding to the arrests, Sreejith's family alleged that more policemen were involved in the 'custodial torture' and demanded that they too be arrested. 
They alleged he was kicked several times on the stomach and thrashed by police personnel. 
The post-mortem report has said that Sreejith died of 'blunt trauma' in the abdomen and there were multiple injuries on his body. 
Meanwhile, the SIT is also probing whether Sreejith was arrested by mistake in connection with Vasudevan's death. 
Vasudevan's son Vineesh had alleged police had mistaken the deceased for another Sreejith, whom he had named in his complaint lodged in connection with his father's death. 
Opposition Congress has sought a court-monitored probe into the incident. 
Both Congress and BJP have demanded that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan give up the Home portfolio. Related Article ",english

Sudhi,"Can’t spare woman judge, HC tells actor","April 19, 2018 19:00 IST Updated: April 19, 2018 19:00 IST more-in Rejects her plea in the abduction case 
A senior male judge will hear the sensational female actor abduction and rape case in Kochi. 
The Kerala High Court has refused to consider the plea of the woman actor, reportedly raped inside a moving car, for a woman judge to hear the case. The alleged incident took place in February last year. She had also sought a special court for speedy trial. 
Investigators had arraigned actor Dileep, along with others, as an accused in the case, which attracted widespread attention. 
The woman actor had earlier approached Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan with the request and he forwarded the request to the Kerala High Court. 
Judicial sources said it was unusual for a witness, who is also the victim in the case, to seek a woman judge and a special court to consider the case, though at times the court receives request for speedy trial of cases. 
The request for a woman judge could not be entertained due to non-availability of women officers. Of the two available in the district, one was awaiting her transfer to another district and the other one was the presiding officer of a CBI court and she cannot be spared, sources said. 
Moreover, the Kerala High Court had earlier issued an internal memorandum directing that the senior-most Principal District and Sessions Judge should hear the controversial cases. Probably, Kauser Edappagath, senior Principal District and Sessions Judge, Ernakulam, will consider the case. 
The schedule of the trial, to be held in-camera, would be fixed by the judge. The doors and windows of the court room would be shut during the trial. There would be a ban on the media reporting the trial, sources said. 
The victim had sought speedy trial as she apprehended that the witnesses would be won over by the accused, who were rich and powerful. On that prayer, the High Court issued instructions to try the case expeditiously, sources said. 
However, the judge was unlikely to exclusively devote his time for the woman actor case as he also doubles up as the judge considering the offences against Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes. The judicial officer with supervisory and administrative responsibilities also functions as State Transport Appellate Tribunal, sources said. 
The request for the special court could not be entertained as the Special Court in Ernakulam for trying offences against women and children was already overloaded, sources said.",english

Aluva (Kerala): The three Kerala policemen arrested for the alleged custodial death of a youth have claimed that they were targeted and made scapegoats in the case. 
In a video clipping shared with the media on Thursday, the three police officials can be seen and heard saying that they have been targeted to save others and that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and DGP Loknath Behera should take appropriate action in the case. 
Jithin Raj, Santhosh Kumar and Sumesh, attached to the Armed Police camp, were part of a special squad of Ernakulam Police. They were arrested on Wednesday after several hours of interrogation. 
Sreejith, 26, who hailed from Varapuzha near here, was arrested on April 7 after 56-year-old Vasudevan hanged himself when a group of men barged into his house and threatened him. 
The special squad took Sreejith and nine others into custody and charged them with abetment to suicide and rioting. Subsequently, Sreejith was taken to a hospital where he died on April 9. 
The DGP assured of looking into the video clipping and that he had directed the team led by Inspector General of Police S. Sreejith to ensure that an impartial probe was conducted. 
Informed sources said more arrests were likely in the case. 
Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala told the media in Delhi on Thursday that Chief Minister Vijayan should hand over the home portfolio to someone else as he had proved to be inefficient in handling it. 
""He has been an abject failure since police is having a free run, with no one to control them. A case should be registered against (police officer) A.V. George and there is suspicion behind the arrest of the three policemen,"" the Congress leader said. 
The state government earlier suspended the circle inspector, sub inspector and two other policemen of the Varapuzha police station. SEARCH talking point on sify news Latest Features ",english

We have seen a heated debated on one of the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission that mandates it to look at the 2011 census data for population. This changes the practice of keeping the reference point at the 1971 census data, anachronistic in our times but still providing comfort to some of the States that have lowered their fertility rate and do not want a lower share of taxes from the Centre just because they have managed population better. 
The 40-year gap, between 1971 and 2011, is huge — India has transformed and the southern States, which have done better in terms of population management, worry that they will be penalised while the so-called erstwhile ‘BIMARU’ States will in effect be rewarded for not doing as much work in terms of managing population growth. 
This is a passionate issue, even a political one. However, the unidimensional focus on population benchmarks has left many other important issues undiscussed. 
The Finance Commission is also mandated to recommend a fiscal consolidation roadmap for State governments, which is also a bone of contention given that the Commission is primarily seen to perform the task of devolution of resources between the Centre and the States for a “vertical” balance and the share of the various States to have a ”horizontal” balance. 
After some of the southern State Finance Ministers met in Kerala this month, the Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan noted: “It is not the task of a Finance Commission to create roadmaps for fiscal management or impose its perception of what policies are good for the people of the State — that is for the democratically elected State governments to decide.” 
This brings the debate squarely to the issue of ballooning fiscal deficits, the role of the Central Government in managing this, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act and how the Finance Commission may look at the challenge, which is made more complex by FRBM changes announced in the Union Budgets 2017-18 and 2018-19. 
Notably, the plan and non-plan components of revenue and capital expenditure have been done away with and fiscal deficit will be the target variable in the FRBM Act, not the revenue deficit. This decision came on the recommendation of the committee on FRBM, where the chairman incidentally was NK Singh, also the chairman of the 15th Finance Commission. 
Historically, Finance Commissions have looked at the non-plan revenue deficit component of States and awarded grants for this purpose. This approach will have to be redesigned in the event of discontinuance of plan and non-plan expenditure at the States, which is expected as they follow in the footsteps of the Centre. More importantly, fiscal deficit becoming the target variable by itself has many shortcomings. 
Fiscal deficit reflects the net borrowing requirements of the Central and State governments. This is a “hole” mechanistically filled in and the process continues year-on-year, allowing for no health check on funds required, spends or their quality. In effect, the sanctity of the budgetary process is lost. 
The fiscal deficit and its financing give no view of the demand for resources and the capacity of the government to raise these resources (own and borrowed resources), apart from the Finance Commission awards in terms of tax devolution and statutory grants. Furthermore, the fiscal deficit is a fuzzy number because it can be under- or over-estimated (in the public account, components of reserve funds and deposits can be intra-governmental and may not carry even interest payments). 
Moreover, fiscal deficit is a net concept; it does not recognise repayment obligations by State governments. Since the market borrowings by the State governments have grown following the recommendations of the 12th Finance Commission to do away with loan components from the Centre, it is important to examine the process of the fiscal roadmap taking into account the repayments on market borrowings. 
An innovative concept 
It is because of these shortcomings that one of the two authors here offered in an RBI paper a new and innovative resource gap approach in respect of State governments, called the Basic Resource Gap (BRG). There are three concepts of BRG, termed BRG1, BRG2 and BRG3. Total expenditure is the same but the various versions give a differentiated view of the “gap” by accounting for different classes of receipts. 
BRG1 takes into account the total expenditure (TE) and the State’s own revenues, both tax and non-tax. Thus, BRG1 is the starting point of the resource gap, a clean indicator of how much money is required and how much of it is in the bag. 
BRG2 adds to government revenues another head: own capital receipts, which includes all public accounts borrowings such as provident funds, reserve funds and deposits of the State governments. 
BRG3 takes into account the constitutional transfers from the Central Government in terms of tax devolution and statutory grants-in–aid, non-statutory grants on the revenue receipt side and loans from the Centre, including repayments and consolidated fund borrowings or repayments thereof. 
In principle, Ways and Means Advances (WMA) and overdraft from the RBI should not constitute resources for State governments as these are to meet sudden and temporary mismatches. Thus, ultimately BRG3 becomes the Total Resource Requirement (TRR) and we have the fiscal “golden rule” that says: TE = TRR. 
The operational relevance of three variants of BRG is that these concepts help us look at the dynamics of the evolving fiscal position. The Resource Dependency Ratio (RDR) is calculated with a ratio of BRG1 and BRG 2 to total expenditure and gives a view of resources required from the Finance Commission award; it can show to what extent the award of the Finance Commission will be helpful to meet the total expenditure needs of the State governments. 
The ratios of BRG3 and BRG1 and BRG3 and BRG2 mirror the Resource Stress Ratios (RSR) for the State governments originating from three institutional sources — Finance Commission (tax devolution and statutory grants), Central Government (loans from Centre and non-statutory grants) and the financial market (consolidated fund market borrowings.) 
To sum up, the fiscal consolidation roadmap with the three variants of BRG has the merit of recognising the fiscal dependency in a federal set-up and fiscal stress in a market-oriented approach to raise resources. 
This helps navigate ahead at a time of crisis, when trust is low and the very idea of the Finance Commission suggesting and opining on State spends has raised a red flag with some southern States. A deficit signals a deficiency. A resource gap attaches no stigma. 
It’s a mature calculation of needs to fulfil required expenditures — and offers a granular view that can hold a mirror to what is required and what needs to be done — or not done in the process of making a Budget and running a government.

Viju Jacob, managing director, Synthite Industries Ltd. 
Bengaluru: Unhappy over pro-Communist unionists disrupting business, Synthite Industries Ltd, billed as the world’s largest spice extract firm, is planning to pack its bags and leave its business in Kerala where it was founded back in 1972. 
The company has an iconic status in Kerala, a state that is not quite known to be pro-business and has produced only a handful of billionaires. 
Synthite founder C.V. Jacob started his company in 1972 with around ten people and an investment of Rs5 lakh in a small shed in Kolenchery town in Ernakulam district. It now employs more than 2,500 people, with a turnover of Rs1,800 crore and accounting for more than 50% of Indian exports of spice extracts, as per the company. 
Viju Jacob, the eldest son of Jacob and the company’s current managing director, said in a phone interview that his decision is partly because of Kerala’s Left Democratic Front government’s failure to live up to investors expectations. 
Since coming to power in 2016, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had repeatedly vowed to make Kerala investor-friendly, partly because he is faced with a shortage of money to run the state, a move that has made him seem more market-friendly than his Communist predecessors but has earned the wrath of many within the Left, including his partner in power, Communist Party of India. 
The problems for the company, as per Jacob, started with the formation of a unit of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, CITU, affiliated to the state’s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM, in December. Shortly afterwards, the union opposed the company’s plans to transfer seven workers to units outside Kerala. 
The local CITU union president Arun Kumar paints a different picture. He said the seven employees are active unionists who had managed to successfully negotiate an increase in wages for casual labour from Rs240 to Rs315 per day. 
This, among other matters, irked the company and the transfer is a form of punishment, Kumar said over the phone. He alleged that the transfer orders are against labour laws. 
Jacob responded, “For the last 45 years, we had no union. This is an instigated union. We got factories in different locations, from Ongole in Andhra Pradesh to one in even China. It’s only a transfer that we are doing, they are not willing to take it. We have transferred people from Kerala to China (before).” 
Kumar refutes this by saying that this is the first time company is transferring someone outside the state. It always sent people outside the state on deputation, which the union has no problems with, says Kumar. 
Jacob says in the last ten days, agitations have intensified, and it has made him lose faith in Kerala. “They started agitating, putting pandal, started abusing the management. We want to exit is because there is no potential.” 
He adds that his efforts to contact the chief minister to resolve the tussle with the unions have not been successful. “I wrote a message to him. The very next day he replied, he said he will give police protection and will ask the labour minister to intervene. But since they are having some meeting in Hyderabad, nothing happened.” 
Vijayan is away from Kerala currently for the CPM’s five-day-long party congress. 
“I was the person who was invited by the government to talk about Kerala in Delhi about three or four months back. And I spoke that Kerala is a good place to invest, the government is very supportive... Within three weeks down the line, this has happened,” Jacob said. 
Jacob says as part of a possible exit, the company has already slowed down its production in Kerala, where it has invested about Rs300 crore, and has started moving raw materials to outside the state-- mostly to Andhra Pradesh “where the chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is welcoming us with open hands.” 
“Kerala will be closed down, that’s it,” Jacob said. First Published: Fri, Apr 20 2018. 12 51 AM IST",english

TRIVANDRUM: Three policemen held for the custodial death of a young man say they were being made scapegoats to save superiors.In a video message addressed to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and police chief Loknath Behera, they requested their intervention to get the investigation process straight.Police in civvies picked up SR Sreejith, 26, from his home in the port city of Kochi on the night of April 6 and they allegedly began kicking and beating him up from that moment.They shifted him to a hospital the next day where he died. The autopsy found 18 wounds, big and small, on the body of the young labourer.The police chief had since suspended seven officers, including the circle inspector, and constituted a departmental inquiry headed by inspector general S. Sreejith.On Wednesday, he arrested Jitin Raj, Santosh Kumar and Sumesh, all belonging to the Rural Tiger Force (RTF) formed by the district police chief to catch criminals on the run.They face charges of murder of a man arrested in a case of mistaken identity.Four other cops, including Varappuzha sub-inspector GS Deepak and North Paravur circle-inspector Crispin Sam, are also under suspension.“They were arrested based on solid evidence. We’ll arrest all the culprits in the case,” Sreejith told reporters in Kochi.“We have also constituted a five-member medical board to analyse the post-mortem report, which is vital for further investigation.” The RTF personnel were accused of acting on false information that Sreejith was part of a gang that attacked his neighbour, Vasudevan, who later committed suicide.“His mother woke him up and sent him with us. We then handed him over the police arrived from the local police station,” one of them was seen saying in the video.“We took a tuk-tuk and left for another place a kilometre away. They didn’t talk to us after that. So strongly feel that there’s a conspiracy against us. We also should get justice.” The Congress-led opposition rejected the ongoing investigation and asked Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to take up the moral responsibility for the collapse of law and order. Vijayan and his senior ministers are away in Hyderabad attending the national meeting of his Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Hyderabad.",english

A special investigation team (SIT) probing the case submitted the report to the judicial magistrate court in North Paravur on Thursday, even as a video clip, purportedly of the arrested officers, started doing the rounds, saying they were made scapegoats in the case.
“It is revealed that the accused persons assaulted Sreejith using their hands and legs after taking him into custody on the pathway and road before he was taken into the police vehicle,” the report said, adding that injuries to the internal organs turned fatal for the man.
Analysis of call data records also showed the involvement of the accused persons, who were members of the now-disbanded Rural Tiger Force , in the crime, the report read.
The SIT also opposed granting bail to the accused persons, citing that they were influential police officers, now under suspension.
Policemen Santhoshkumar P P, Jithin Raj and Sumesh M S were arrested on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, in a video, the accused persons claimed they were made scapegoats to protect higher officers. Jithin, Santosh and Sumesh were seen in the video requesting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and DGP Loknath Behera for a proper investigation.
The policemen were produced before the North Paravur magistrate and were remanded in judicial custody on Thursday. They have been charged under sections 302 (punishment for murder), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC.
In the video made two days ago and now released by their relatives, the cops alleged a conspiracy behind targeting them in the case. They said they had reported to the inspector of North Paravur police circle following a directive from the control room. On the instruction of the CI, they went to Sreejith’s house in plainclothes, and picked him up.
“He was sent in one of the two police vehicles waiting outside. We then proceeded to nab another man in the case pertaining to the attack on the house of one Vasudevan, in an auto rickshaw,” said Kumar, expressing their wiliness to undergo a lie-detection test. They also cited that they were also lauded by their superiors for the ‘good job’.

(PTI) HYDERABAD: With hours remaining for a thrilling climax to the ideological fight in CPM between two political lines led by Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury respectively, Express takes a look at the shrinking ground for the Left in states other than Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura. It's this alarming scenario that led to an alternative political line in the party. Its fast shrinking vote percentage across the country is a major cause of worry for the Left. ALSO READ: Left leader suggests worker-farmer alliance, Left democratic front including Congress, to defeat BJP-RSS While the CPM polled 0.71 percent votes in Bihar in 2010, it was down to just 0.6 percent in 2015. Similarly in Uttar Pradesh, the party could garner only half of its previous vote share in the last elections, that too by contesting in 26 seats compared to 17 seats in the previous time. All Left parties together could not gain even one percent of the votes. The story is almost the same in Punjab. Compared to 2012 when the party contested nine seats, the vote share dipped to just half from 12 seats during the last election. In Uttarakhand, the vote share became one third in the last election, compared to 2012. Look at Tamil Nadu. All it could gain was just 0.7 percent vote share from 25 seats. In Assam, the the percentage went down further as the party got only 0.6 percent from 19 seats. All the Left parties together got only 0.9 percent. Despite the shrinking vote percentage, the CPM units in some states are adamant in their stance against allying with the Congress. Though it was the Kerala unit that spearheaded the attack against Yechury's political tactical line at the Party Congress on Thursday, delegates from a few other states too did not spare their punches. Sources said that except for one, almost all delegates from Telangana and Andhra were highly critical of the proposal to join hands with the Congress. While one of the delegates termed Yechury a revisionist, another felt that the Left should in no way join forces with its class enemy. Of the three representing Kerala at the discussion, Ernakulam district secretary P Rajeeve and Kollam district secretary KN Balagopal spoke on Thursday. There was a general feeling that Rajeeve would set the ground for Kerala's stance, while KK Ragesh would take it forward, with KN Balagopal imparting the finishing touch. ""Beginning the onslaught on the alternative line, Rajeeve said the same would be akin to questioning the very identify of the party. The Kerala delegates -in general- pointed out that any kind of understanding with the Congress would be in violation of the party programme which tags both BJP and Congress as imperialist and capitalist. How can the Left join hands with such a party,"" asked one of the delegates. KN Balagopal too voiced support of the Karat line in the evening on behalf of the Kerala unit. Assam and Himachal Pradesh party delegates too were quick to reject the Yechury line during discussions. ""Who let the party secretary sabotage the political line taken at the last Party Congress? We have organised agitations against the corrupt practices of the Congress-led government. How can we now even think of a tie-up with them?"" one of the delegates asked. Left unity In a curious development, a couple of CPM state leaderships have started mooting third front proposals, while the fact remains that the CPM was unable to bring together all the Left parties under a single umbrella in many states. The Telangana CPM has already floated the idea of a rainbow alliance of around 28 parties. ""In addition to CPM, other parties like MCPI, RSP, MBT, BSP, AAP, T Loksatta, Telangana Labour Party and Bagunana Rajyadhikara party are expected to be part of such an alliance. The initial discussions have begun. The front would function on the common premise on how the Dalits and the minority sections are not being given their due,"" said Telangana CPM secretary Veerbhadran. Unlike in Kerala, where the Left is in a comparatively comfortable position, the political scenario seems different in many other states. In states like Bihar, the CPI(ML) does not stand with the Left. In Kerala and West Bengal, the SUCI is not with the Left front. Even in Kerala, prominent Left parties like the RSP and the Forward Bloc are with the Congress-led United Democratic Front. That could be one reason that the CPI, while repeatedly underscoring the need for Left unity, reiterates its position of a wide Left, secular, democratic platform - obviously including the Congress - as the immediate need of the hour.

Chief Editor of Kerala Kaumudi M.S. Ravi, 68, died here on Friday. He collapsed at his house in the afternoon and was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead at 3 p.m. 
Mr. Ravi was the fourth son of Kerala Kaumudi founder editor K. Sukumaran and Madhavi Sukumaran. He succeeded his elder brother M.S. Mani as chief editor. Mr. Ravi was an energetic presence in the State’s social and cultural circuit. He was also a recipient of several awards. 
His wife Shailaja; his brother M.S. Mani; and sons Deepu Ravi, Editor, Kerala Kaumudi; and Darshan Ravi, director-marketing; survive him. His brothers M.S. Madhusoodhanan and M.S. Sreenivasan had passed away earlier. 
Governor P. Sathasivam said the untimely demise of Mr. Ravi had saddened him deeply. He described Mr. Ravi as a socially-committed editor who had an abiding concern for the welfare of the weaker sections of society. Mr. Ravi always upheld the high standards of journalistic conduct. 
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan described Mr. Ravi as yet another strong link in the line of determined and forceful editors who had steered Kerala Kaumudi through the years. 
Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala described Mr. Ravi as an editor who always faced the world with an endearing smile. Under him, Kerala Kaumudi had reached greater heights and forayed into the new media. 
Cremation today 
The mortal remains of Mr. Ravi will be cremated with full State honours on the newspaper’s precincts on Saturday. 
A press release by Kerala Kaumudi said the cremation would take place near the resting place of the newspaper’s founder-editor M. Sukumaran at 4 p.m. Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran on Friday laid a floral wreath on the body on behalf of the State government.",english

Hartals (strikes) are nothing new to Kerala. But when a call for hartal over the social media evokes an unprecedented response wreaking havoc across five districts of the state, leading to large scale violence in certain pockets that are dominated by one particular community, it certainly rings the alarm bells for the state's law enforcing agency. 
The Kerala police are however not mincing their words this time round. The state police chief who is otherwise tight-lipped over sensitive issues has spoken out loud and clear. 
""There has certainly been an attempt to inflame communal passions through the social media which had resulted in this hartal . We have enough evidence to believe that aim was to create a communal riot like situation in the state. We cannot let this happen in Kerala at any cost and it will be dealt with an iron hand,"" said Lokanath Behera, Director General of Police, Kerala. Representational image. Getty images 
Even when police chief claims that he would take all steps to not let a communal riot burst out in the state, what happened in certain pockets in Kerala on Monday was nothing short of it as the police clearly failed to preempt such a scenario. 
Tanur, a little town in Muslim dominated Malappuram was the worst hit as rioters vandalised shops, stoned vehicles and burned tyres on the national highway. 
Pictures of young men with their faces half covered stoning the policemen prompted people to draw similarities between Kerala's hartal with the protests witnessed in Kashmir valley. 
North Kerala was on the boil like never before but with none to take the blame for it. Perhaps for the first time in the state there was a hartal without anyone to own responsibility. 
But the narrative was all too evident. The brutal crime committed at Kathua on the eight year old had taken a complete communal colour. It was Hindu vs Muslim. 
After the fire burned out the state police clearly had no doubts that the Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political arm the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), both Islamist separatist groups had ignited it. 
""We have credible evidence to believe that the PFI and SDPI workers are the ones who led the violence at many places. There may have been others also involved. A lot of youth who had no political allegiance have also been arrested. But the whole thing was managed by these hardline groups. Once we track the origin of the message we will get to the bottom of it. A proxy server seems to have been used to spread the message around,’"" a senior official who is investigating Monday's incidents told FirstPost . 
According to the numbers released by the police 265 PFI/SDPI activists have been booked for rioting out of a total 951 who have been arrested till mid-week. 
But what is baffling even the police is another statistics. Out of the rest of 686 arrests made, 270 people swear allegiance with the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), 125 are CPM activists, 60 are Congress workers and around 235 have no direct political leanings. 
Hameed Chennamangaloor, a sociologist and a political critic based out of north Kerala, explains this strange mix of protesters: ""See we always thought that workers from other parties lose their cadre to the hardline groups. But this incident pan-Kerala actually shows that such hardline Islamist elements have successfully infiltrated the rank and file of major political parties in Kerala. They are forming sub groups inside these political parties, which will then take forward their radical ideology inside these mainstream political parties. It is a terribly dangerous slope that we are slipping off from."" 
Chennamangaloor says that this trend can only be arrested if mainstream political parties come forward to reject the radical outlook in strong terms. But with electoral ambitions in sight, hardly anyone would take that step. 
Definite PFI imprints 
To make more sense of the turn of events FirstPost talked to the top brass of the PFI and SDPI in Kerala. 
While they are outright denying any such official call given for a hartal , both the organisations have not only shied away from condemning Monday's violence but are also in spirit supportive of everything that happened on the hartal day. 
Naseeruddin Elamaram is the state president of the PFI in Kerala. Speaking to Firstpost from Kozhikode he puts across his own arguments defending the violence. 
""What happened on Monday was a display of the anger of genuine people to the misrule of the Modi government in the last four years. Kathua rape is only the tipping point. See what all inhuman acts have happened in the last few years. Killing in the name of cow, love jihad, how can people tolerate all this? They will surely react. These protests were only a reflection of the existing situation,"" Elamaram told Firstpost . 
When asked about the violence his cadre allegedly unleashed on the streets, Elamaram had a more bizarre take. 
""Has there been any hartal in Kerala which has not seen violence? All political parties have unleashed violence before, why single this out? Just because the slogans were against the RSS?"" asks Elamaram. 
However his next argument is perhaps a definite give-away on the real ownership of Monday's violence. 
When asked more on the anti-Hindu tenor of the hartals , Elamarum counters, ""How is anti-RSS sloganeering anti-Hindu? Definitely this was an anti-RSS hartal, no doubt in that. Not a single slogan was against any community. I can vouch for it and unlike the news being spread, no Hindu establishment was attacked in the hartal."" 
The conviction in Elamarum's voice as he explains the exact nature of protests and defends them, further raises questions if PFI indeed planned, fanned, and tacitly supported the hartal . But PFI president's claim of the hartal being just an anti-RSS affair falls flat because as per eye witness accounts in many places small establishments owned by Hindus were singled out and attacked, something which even the Muslim League agrees to. 
For instance in Tanur alone, the sloganeering was not only brazenly communal but bakeries and other shops belonging to Hindu community were attacked in particular, which the SDPI now claims is collateral damage of the protest. 
""Calling the hartal anti-Hindu is only an attempt to colour it communal. This was a mass protest by youngsters who are very emotional, so naturally it became violent. Now the police have even arrested youngsters who have shared the hartal messages on Facebook and WhatsApp which is wrong. We will soon protest against it,"" claims Abdul Majeed Faizi, state president of the SDPI. 
The SDPI may have its own narrative but ground reports from across all five districts in north Kerala, along with some pockets in the southern part, say that the tone of the hartal was high communal putting an entire community in the dock for the Kathua crime which is why the DGP himself called it an attempt to create a communal riot. 
Polarisation was the aim 
Social observers say that it is a well concerted effort to divide the society among Hindus and Muslims and then fish in the troubled waters for their respective gains. 
""It is beyond a doubt that this was indeed an attempt to hijack a sensitive issue like the rape of this young Muslim girl and create a narrative of Hindu vs Muslim so that certain separatist organisations can pursue their radical ambitions . What is alarming is that at every place the attack was targeted at one community,"" says CR Neelakandan, political commentator and convenor of Aam Admi Party in Kerala. 
What is most dangerous is that post Monday's hartal the so called torchbearers of both the communities have started a sustained polarisation effort over social media. Groups across Facebook and WhatsApp have been spewing communal venom like never before, further dividing an already divided society in Kerala. 
""This so called self proclaimed hartal has immensely helped in dividing Kerala communally in the last few days. Especially in the post hartal period, it's the Hindu groups that are now hitting back. By doing such a violent hartal , these Muslim fringe groups have literally played into the hands of the Hindu fringe groups. Now it's a competition between the two, which could once again spill on to the streets,"" KM Shajahan, noted social activist and left ideologue told Firstpost . 
Shajahan says that such polarisation could also get reflected in the electoral process in the near future. A consolidation of the Hindu vote bank in favour of the BJP could very well be a major fallout of such meaningless communal aggression. 
Many believe that it could also be the reason the RSS failed to retort to the violence unleashed on Monday. A victim card in run up to the Chengannur by-polls could also help the BJP and the Sangh Parivar is well aware of it, which explains their silence. 
CPM's soft stand on terror 
The CPM goes soft against such radical elements, is an allegation that has been doing the rounds ever since the Pinarayi Vijayan government came to power in 2016. 
But political pundits say that it is only a reflection of the red party's policy degeneration in terms of joining hands with anyone as long as it brings electoral gains. 
""It was the Left which had been acting as a vanguard against communalism in Kerala for decades. From there the Left has succumbed to the whims and fancies of the communal forces, not only the Islamist but also the majority Hindutva forces. Apart from a few noises what has it done against fringe radical preachers like Sasikala teacher? Even the Opposition to RSS supremo Mohan Bhagwat's flag hoisting ceremony was just a farce. So if the secular fabric of Kerala is lost tomorrow, the Left has a huge share of blame to take,"" Shajahan says. 
Not only the political party, the Left intelligentsia too had been contributing heavily to the growth of Islamist separatism in the state. 
""If you want to arrest communalism you need to condemn it outright. Instead, many of the Left writers and intelligentsia are acting as advocates for minority separatism to grow. They attend their seminars, programmes and end up legitimising their radical ideology which is not what Left parties and their ideologues should be doing,"" Chennamangaloor ads. 
While the CPM continues to be in denial about their cadre crossing the fence, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is a terribly worried lot. 
That a party that had always took an anti-communal stand even in the period around Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, is now fading away to irrelevance and a lot of its cadre are opting for the more radical SDPI or Welfare party is also a matter of grave concern. 
""The league is seeing this as a very dangerous development in Kerala. It is a trend that needs to be countered and we will be calling a meetings soon to address the issue,"" says KPA Majeed, General Secretary, IUML. 
The BJP has meanwhile approached the National Investigating Agency to look into Monday's violence and take necessary action. 
If sources are to be believed the central government too is shocked at the turn of events in Kerala. The urgent flying down of IB chief Rajeev Jain to meet the Kerala police chief is also an indication of ruffled feathers in New Delhi.

(PTI) 
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) amended its tactical line on Friday to allow an “understanding” with the Congress ahead of the 2019 general elections and quelled a rift in the party. 
The CPI(M), however, will not have a political alliance with the Congress, the largest opposition party. The middle path on the tactical line was arrived at after a politburo meeting on Friday. 
Factions associated with general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Prakash Karat had been trading charges against each other over the political-tactical line at the 22nd Party Congress in Hyderabad. 
The final version of the political-tactical line replaced the phrase “without any understanding or electoral alliance with the Congress” and added “without political alliance with the Congress.”

As the two factions have come to an understanding, party insiders said that Sitaram Yechury is set to get another term as general secretary as his demands have been met. 
Speaking at the party Congress, Yechury had insisted that he was not seeking permission for an electoral alliance with the Congress. 
“There is no dispute over an electoral alliance with the Congress. There is no dispute in the priority that the BJP should be defeated. Each one of us knows that our priority is to get rid of the BJP-RSS government. The only difference is on how to achieve this target,” he had said at a press conference earlier this week. 
Karat too had tried to show flexibility, saying that the political-tactical line and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections should not be mixed up. tags",english

HYDERABAD: Amidst demands for secret ballot on draft political resolution, Polit Bureau Member Prakash Karat said that the party Congress will take a call on it as party constitution only allows secret ballot in case of Central Committee and lower commitee elections. 
""It is not our practice. There has not been any instance of voting by secret ballot in our constitution. The decision will be taken by the party Congress based on the amendments moved by delegates by evening,"" said Karat. 
About 47 delegates have given their views by afternoon and based on that amendments will be taken up and put to vote, if pressed for. 
""I am confident that there will be political resolution by today evening,"" he said 
Lobbying and last minute efforts are being made by both Karat and Yechury camp with demands for voting. Part's steering committee will take a call based on the demands from delegates. 
According to sources, about 15 delegates from Maharashtra, Punjab, Odisha, Goa and Bihar have demanded a secret ballot to decide on the draft political resolution. 
When asked if he presented the majority draft so reply on political draft will be given by him, Karat said ""off course"" and there have been many such precedents. 
""There is no majority or minority draft. Once a draft is adopted by the party Congress, then it's the party line,"" said Karat. 
The usual practice is to have voting on draft political resolution by raising hand and there has been no previous precedence of secret ballot in the party's history. 
Karat presented the majority draft that is against any understanding with the Congress in elections, while Yechury wants that doors should not be completly shut keeping in mind need to defeat the BJP. 
There have been reports that the steering committee will make efforts that the situation doesn't come for a secret ballot. Related Article ",english

The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government of trying to utilize the 15th Finance Commission to ""further centralise financial powers"". 
The party adopted a resolution to this effect at the ongoing 22nd Party Congress here while observing that the TOR were ""intended"" to reduce the share of the states in the overall tax devolution and ""squeeze the fiscal space"" available to them. 
The resolution also took strong exception to one of the terms of reference which speaks of ""control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures"", saying: ""Whether a programme is populist or not is a decision to be made in the political domain and not by the Finance Commission."" 
""The TOR suggest that the 15th Finance Commission should review the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission to raise the share of states in central taxes to 42 per cent. Further, they ask whether the constitutional provision to provide revenue deficit grants to states be continued at all. The policies that follow from both of these will certainly reduce resource devolution to the states. 
""There are clear suggestions that the Finance Commission enforce the recommendations of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act Review Committee Report. Any such move will significantly reduce the fiscal deficit and debt-GDP ratio permitted for the states, and will severely curtail the fiscal space available to states,"" it added. 
The resolution expressed concern that shifting the base year for calculation of population weight from 1971 to 2011 in the TOR of the Commission would result in ""heavy loss of revenue to states that have effectively implemented appropriate health and family planning programmes"", including the southern states, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab. 
""There is a bias in the TOR towards giving primacy to central government programmes. It may also be noted that the objectives of most of these centrally-sponsored programmes fall within the domain of the states,"" it claimed. 
Noting that the fiscal imbalance between the Centre and the states has widened over time as from the 11th Finance Commission onwards, the central grants have ""increasingly tended to be subject to conditions imposed on the states"", the CPI-M said that the adoption of GST has been a ""blow to the resource mobilisation potential of the states"". 
""The 22nd Congress of the CPI-M appeals to the people to rally to demand amendments to the TOR, in order that the 15th Finance Commission, which is a Constitutional body, be able to function in a free and just manner,"" it said.

When the Pinarayi Vijayan government first established the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), an autonomous body, in June 2016, a number of public finance experts predicted it would be “yet another misadventure” considering Kerala’s economy was in the doldrums. But thumbing its nose at the doomsayers, KIIFB has made remarkable progress. Finance minister Thomas Isaac says, “KIIFB is no wonder cure for our many ills. We introduced it as an experiment to tackle our various development handicaps… and the results have been encouraging.” Isaac says traditional means to source funds would have needed another 20 years to fill the gaps, hence “the special [purpose] vehicle (SPV) to raise funds and to secure future revenues” . 
Despite meeting global standards in several social indices, what Kerala lacks is infrastructure. A traffic survey in 2016 revealed that the 550 km from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasargod took 17 hours to cover. This was because new road construction had been at a virtual standstill due to land acquisition issues. Successive governments had baulked at antagonising landowners and religious groups who held large holdings. Result: bottlenecks became the ‘norm’. 
When he took charge in May 2016, CM Vijayan had declared that all national highways would be widened to 45 metres, and that he would yield to no pressure. A first step to this-amending the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Act 1999 and create the KIIFB. The government transferred 50 per cent of road tax collections and the fuel cess to it. Besides the Rs 4,270 crore accrued from vehicle tax and fuel cess, the state is also planning public ‘bonds’ to bring in money. 
But there are hindrances. The land acquisition protests in Keezhattur and Malappuram have the support of opposition parties, and in some areas, the ruling CPI(M) too. But work goes on. KIIFB CEO K.M.

http://mybs.in/2VmAilJ CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, CPI(M) politburo member Prakash Karat and other leaders attend the 5-day- long 22nd Congress of the CPI(M) at RTC Kalyana Mandapam in Hyderabad (Photo: PTI) ALSO READ CPM conclave: Brace for Sitaram Yechury vs Prakash Karat battle in April Karat says Yechury didn't offer to quit even as CPI(M) chief claims he did Sitaram Yechury, Prakash Karat and the legacy of Harkishan Singh Surjeet The contradiction-ridden CPI (M) political draft resolution 
In the face of massive support for Communist Party of India (Marxist) chief Sitaram Yechury from party delegates, the Prakash Karat camp on Friday conceded a compromise on the party’s future political line. 
The compromise averted a vote on the draft political line, and Karat indicated this was in the interest of party unity. The compromise also suggested that Yechury would continue as the party chief for a second three-year term. 
While the truce in its phrasing carries nuance typical of CPI(M) documents, it leaves elbow room for the West Bengal unit of the party to explore a seat adjustment with the Congress party in that state. 
It would also allow the CPI(M) to explore adjustments with the Congress party akin to 2004 Lok Sabha elections. The CPI(M) had then entered into seat adjustments with the Congress party in handful of constituencies in Andhra Pradesh. 
The party conclave in Hyderabad adopted the main political resolution with an amendment on Friday. 
It deleted Karat’s formulation that the CPI(M) has to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamseavak Sangh “without having an understanding or electoral alliance with the Congress Party.” The words ""electoral understanding"" and ""electoral alliance"" were deleted. 
A new clause was added that the BJP-RSS have to be defeated “without having a political alliance with the Congress Party”, which is consistent with the CPI(M)’s line for several years that its struggle for a policy alternative will be weakened if it has an alliance with the Congress, ""a party of the ruling classes"". 
The Karat camp sensed where the wind was blowing when party delegates demanded an unprecedented secret ballot to decide on the political line. The Karat camp, supported by Tripura and Kerala units of the party, was isolated with delegates from 16 other state units supporting Yechury’s line. 
There were divisions in the Kerala unit as well, with veteran party leader, former Kerala chief minister, V S Achuthanandan also supporting Yechury. 
When delegates demanded a secret ballot, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and former Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar worked out a compromise formula in the interest of party unity, sources said. 
But challenges remain for Yechury. In the remaining two days of the conclave, the delegates will be electing a new central committee, the CPI(M)’s highest decision making body. 
During his first term as the party chief, from 2015-18, Yechury was hobbled by a central committee where the majority of its members are aligned with the Karat camp. 
Yechury’s challenge in 2018, however, is qualitatively different from the one he faced in 2015. 
In 2015, it was more a personal battle for Yechury to become the general secretary of the party. Now in 2018, Yechury has to lead the party into a bitter ideological and electoral battle with the BJP in 2019, and could find the new central committee more amenable to his leadership.

M Sugathan, Mithun’s father, told Mirror that he has no doubt that his son died during the ‘Saddle Sore 1000' challenge of US-based Iron Butt Association (IBA).

""I don't know how long my son was involved in this online contest. I, however, hear that he had once taken a part in a long distance journey,"" Sugathan said.
Sugathan, an ex-journalist, his wife S Priya and their daughter left for Chengannur today morning with the mortal remains of their Unni (as they used to call Mithun at home) for the funeral rites.
Currently, Sugathan is into business, while his wife Priya is working as a headmistress in a school near their place.
Sukesh Imam, a friend of Mithun's father, said that Mithun is an expert at both driving and riding. He was also of a calm nature and automobiles were his obsession. He was doing final year automobile engineering from a private college at Pampady in Thrissur district.
Apparently, a senior of Mithun had completed the challenge successfully while one Babu Antony returned without being able to complete the challenge sometime ago.

Sukesh has gathered all the hand-written documents from Mithun’s room after his death. The documents shows that Mithun has researched on his journey and made a thorough plan, however he was aware of the risk involved in it. Sukesh shared the photos of the pages with Mirror.
Sugathan encouraged his son's love for automobiles with the belief that this would help his son from falling prey to drugs or other such habits.
Reportedly, Mithun left home on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, cops informed his parents that Mithun died in a road accident at Chitradurga. The bike which Mithun was riding collided with a truck and killed him on the spot.
Some reports suggest that Mithun had left home with an aim to cover 1624 kilometres in 24 hours and he had posted videos of some stages of the challenge on his social media account.

Party general secretary Sitaram Yechury has finally had his way, as the 22nd party congress on Friday brought in an official amendment to its draft political tactical line, favouring the West Bengal backed Yechury line. Despite the consensus, it could well be termed a setback to the Kerala CPM, which has been pushing for the Karat line. 
In an apparent move to keep the windows open for a Congress alliance, the wording ‘without having an understanding with the Congress’ has been excluded from the resolution. The climbdown in the Karat line has been made apparently in the wake of the Tripura setback. 
After threatening to snowball into a major rift within the CPM - which could have even led to a split within the party - a consensus move was least expected from the top brass. That the proposal for consensus was moved by none other than Kerala strongman and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not go unnoticed. 
With delegates from around 15 states demanding a secret ballot on the political resolution and the Karat-led official faction maintaining that such a practice was never part of party history, there were indications of an open rift. Highly placed sources said the politburo that acts as the steering committee for the 22nd party congress decided to make the necessary amendments so as to leave a window open for any profitable electoral alliance. Referring to its political tactical line, the draft resolution says, “The main task is to defeat the BJP and its allies by rallying all secular and democratic forces. However, this has to be done without having an understanding or electoral alliance with the Congress party.” 
This sentence has been excluded. Instead, there was another sentence saying, “there won’t be any political alliance with the Congress.” The resolution further says: “Appropriate electoral tactics to maximise the pooling of anti- BJP votes should be adopted based on the above political line of the party.” After the discussion, Yechury said the party should take into consideration the general sentiment of the debate. He also underscored that unity within the party is of prime importance. Earlier, there were hectic parleys within the party to avoid extreme responses from either side. Addressing the delegates, Sitaram Yechury said the steering committee resolved the issue. Then Karat mentioned about Tripura setback and pointed out that in the wake of the new scenario, necessary amendments are being made. Related Article ",english

In a horrifying incident in Kerala, a headless body of a woman was found in an isolated area near the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram. The body is suspected to be of a 33-year-old Latvian woman, Liga Skromane, who went missing in March. Although the victim has been identified by her sister and friend, a detailed forensic examination would be done to scientifically confirm this. As per reports, the decomposed body of Skromane was hanging upside down from a tree, while the head of the body was found lying away from the rest of it, in a marshy spot. 
On Friday, fishermen found the body in a highly decomposed state and alerted the police. The next day, Skromane’s sister and a friend arrived and identified the body from her dress and the hair. The police will conduct an autopsy, which will be followed by a DNA test that is likely to be done at the city-based Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology. After Skromane disappeared last month, her husband Andrew Jordan and sister had appealed Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as well as Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj for helping trace her. 
Skromane had come to Kerala along with her sister Ilzie for ayurvedic treatment at a hospital in the capital outskirts in Thiruvananthapuram following complaints of depression. She, however, went missing on March 14 and was last reported to have taken an auto-rickshaw ride to the famed tourist destination at Kovalam. She was travelling without a passport or mobile phone at the time. Her husband Andrew and her sister had printed her posters and distributed them around to help them lead to any clue. The Kerala Police had also launched a detailed probe to locate her but failed. Empty bottles, cigarettes and a lighter have been recovered from the place where the body was found. 
Cases of crimes against women of foreign origin have surfaced in recent times. In 2017, a 28-year-old Irish woman was killed on her second trip to Goa. She was on a ‘backpack’ trip and had celebrated Holi before she was raped, murdered and left unclothed with her face badly smashed up. In 2008, 15-year-old Scarlett Keeling was raped and killed in Goa. However, in one of the most shocking Verdicts, the Children’s court of Goa acquitted Samson D’Souza and Placido Carvalho, the two men accused of the charges raping and killing Scarlett Keeling.

They are upset that a compensation package negotiated last July is yet to be implemented 
Thiruvananthapuram: Only weeks after farmers in north Kerala planned a long march to the state capital to stop a proposed national highway cutting through their farmlands, nurses in the state have firmed up on plans for a similar march. 
The nurses are seeking a positive response to their long-standing grievance for a better pay package. 
Jasmin Shah, the president of the United Nurses’ Association, which is spearheading the agitation, announced on Saturday that the nurses would launch their indefinite strike on April 24. 
Their plan is to go on a long march to highlight their grievances, from Cherthala to the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. 
From May 12 onwards, the Indian Nurses’ Association will also join the strike, and it is feared that as many as 457 hospitals in the private sector in Kerala will be crippled by the strike. 
Nurses in the state have been upset that a compensation package that was negotiated last July with the intervention of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is yet to be implemented. 
On that occasion, government authorities had agreed to a monthly minimum package of Rs20,000 (Dh1,112), but nearly nine months later the official government order on the matter is awaited.

Police suspect it could be that of a 33-year-old Latvian woman who went missing from the beach town of Kovalam last month.  

Though the woman's sister identified the body this morning, police are waiting for the forensic tests to be completed for an official confirmation. 

Liga Skromane's husband and sister had been frantically searching for her ever since she went missing. She had arrived in Thiruvananthapuram on February 21 for Ayurvedic treatment of post-traumatic depression. On March 14, she went to a beach in Kovalam, about 30 km from the state capital, without informing her sister Ilze Skromane, who had come to India with her. There has been no trace of Liga since then. 

Further details of the state of the body will be known only after the tests, according to police sources. 

The woman's husband Andrew Jordan and sister - who stuck posters on pillars - had appealed Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as well as Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj for helping trace her. They had announced a reward of Rs. one lakh for anyone who gave information on Liga. 

According to the sister, police told her that Liga was last seen on March 19 by locals near Kovalam. But there was no trace of Liga since then. 

Andrew suspects that his wife was kidnapped. ""The police, I think, initially kept thinking that she will return by herself and that she must have gone away for a while. We suspect something else. We believe she must have been taken away by a group that is not letting her off,"" Liga's sister had told NDTV last month.

At the party’s 22nd Congress on Wednesday, Yechury said that mobilizing secular and democratic forces was imperative to strengthen people's struggle for the realization of an alternative policy direction for the country.
This is a sentiment echoed by historian Irfan Habib and Marxist economist Prabhat Patnaik, as writer NS Madhavan specified in a recent article in a Malayalam daily.
Novelist Arundhati Roy was more vocal about the prevailing situation in the country when she said in a recent interview, “I don’t think the country has ever been in a situation like this,” she elaborated at length on why it is no longer the same story where one said that even the Congress party had done the same things when they were in power.
“Woh sab (the wrongs of previous regimes) hai, but right now, there’s an ideological preparation to change the constitution,” an agency report Quote: d her as saying.
The triumph of Yechury’s reasoning, despite stiff resistance from Prakash Karat at the 22nd party conference of the CPI (M) which concluded in Hyderabad on Friday is seen as a setback for Kerala faction led by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who by now has earned the tag of an `authoritarian’, no surprise for someone who openly praises North Korean leader Kim Jong un.
The former chief minister VS Achuthanandan, who was unceremoniously thrown out and replaced by Pinarayi Vijayan for the office after LDF's assembly election victory in Kerala, is perhaps having the last laugh.
Yechury had to indicate to the 22nd Congress that it is held in a period when multifold challenges face both the people and secular democratic republic.
""The current BJP central government whose reins are controlled by the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh is pursuing policies that have imposed unprecedented miseries on the people and, at the same time, grievously threatening the unity and integrity of our social fabric.The dehumanisation of our society is seen in the chilling incidents of rape in Kathua and Unnao recently. It is shameful to see rape being used as weapon for communal polarization. This must be resisted and defeated, he contended.
Manik Sarkar emphasized the need for the party to evolve a proper political tactical line to be pursued in the coming days vigorously to fulfill the desire and aspirations of the common people of the country, to isolate and ensure defeat of the BJP-RSS combine.
""But, obviously, this has to be done without compromising our principled position as well as social and class outlook,he noted.
“Particularly working class, working people, peasantry, and secular-minded, democratic-minded and patriotic people as a whole are anxiously waiting to see the outcome of our Party Congress,” he reminded.

Being the largest left party in the country, the Communist Party of India- Marxist had to bear the brunt for its failure. The ongoing party meet resolve to adopt the minority view in favour of the Congress, that was rejected in the central committee, reflects the mood within the CPI-M ahead of 2019 general elections. The party was ideologically divided into two factions, led by general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who wants a broad platform, including the Congress to take on the BJP in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls and his predecessor Prakash Karat, who shrugged off any relation with the Congress due to its economic policies. File Photo Yechury's effort to adopt a political resolution in favour of the Congress fell short of numbers in the central committee held on January. The move by the general secretary was defeated at 55:31. Not withstanding the defeat, Yechury was successful in turning the tables in the party congress on Friday. A politburo meeting of CPI-M The words in the political-tactical line, “No alliance or understanding with the Congress” has been amended to read as, “No electoral alliance with the Congress.” The word “understanding” has been removed and it would mean a lot to the future political implications. The party, which is not a significant force in states except Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura, could also stimulate the forces countering the BJP in other states with the amended resolution. Leaders from Kerala including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan with politburo member Brinda Karat The Kerala state unit, which supported Karat's line, had all rights to fear of an alliance propping up with the Congress. The party is fighting tooth and nail against the Congress and any pact will only strengthen the BJP's claim of 'friends in Delhi, but foes in Kerala'. Sitaram Yechury, Prakash Karat with leaders from West Bengal The Bengal faction was disgruntled by the clout enjoyed by the Kerala leaders, who now forms the majority in all decision making platforms, politburo and the central committee. In Pic: Prakash Karat Karat's argument of no electoral pact was corroborated by the 2016 West Bengal poll results, where Congress edged past CPI-M to become the second largest party in the Assembly with an alliance with the Left. Dilemma becomes mild for the Congress as it can persuade other parties to its fold for a rainbow alliance against the Narendra Modi-led NDA after the changed political stand of the CPI-M. The CPI-M can also act as a glue in case a formation of a broad front is on the cards. Opposition members during a meet to decide its vice presidential candidate The movements of parties like the Telugu Desam Party, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, the Biju Janata Dal, which are not inclined towards any major national political alliances could be worth watchful in the current situation. Prakash Karat with TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu Yechury can relax at the moment as he could drift a minority view as the party's political stand and can brace up CPI-M for 2019 as a unified house.",english

According to an NDTV report, the woman's sister identified the body on Saturday morning. However, the police are waiting for forensic reports for an official confirmation.

Liga Skromane, a resident of Ireland, has been missing from Kerala's Kovalam since March 14, 2018. Her husband Andrew Jordan (42) and her sister Ilze Skormane had been frantically wandering around the streets looking for Liga since she left.
Andrew, holding a poster of his wife's photo had also offered to give a reward of Rs 1 lakh for anyone who gives information about Liga or help find her.

The aversion to Hindi is nowhere near as virulent now, with the language being taught in schools in the state, and more and more locals, at least in big cities, becoming somewhat familiar with it, thanks to interactions with migrants from the North. But Hindi still hits a raw nerve, as has been made clear in recent years. 

It happened in 2014, when political parties in Tamil Nadu opposed the Home Ministry’s directive to bureaucrats to use Hindi on the government’s official social media accounts. Something similar happened a year ago, when Hindi reportedly replaced English on national highway milestones. The hashtag #StopHindiChauvinisim trended on Twitter. Tamil Nadu’s neighbour Karnataka is also prone to bristling at the use of Hindi on signages. In July 2017, pro-Kannada activists defaced Hindi signs at Bengaluru metro stations, forcing Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to write to the Urban Affairs Ministry to waive its three-language rule on the metro. (The Bengaluru metro project is a joint venture between Central and state governments.) 


The anti-Hindi agitations are anti-Delhi and anti-Centre, not necessarily against north India, says Narendar Pani, professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru. “The anti-Hindi agitation can also become anti-Malayalam or anti-Tamil, depending on where you are.” If there were murmurs of a disconnect between the North and the South following these incidents, they have only become louder lately with the controversy over the 15th Finance Commission. 


Where’s the Money? 
The finance ministers of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Puducherry met in Thiruvananthapuram on April 10 to express their displeasure over a crucial change in the 15th Finance Commission. 


(Tamil Nadu and Telangana finance ministers did not attend.) Instead of using the 1971 population data to determine states’ share of tax receipts, the 15th Finance Commission shall use 2011 Census figures. This, the states say, leads to a loss of revenue for them and the commission is punishing them for their population control efforts relative to other states. For instance, Kerala’s population growth between 1971 and 2011 is only a third of Rajasthan’s, and Tamil Nadu’s growth is less than half of Haryana’s. 



The 14th Finance Commission was the first to use the 2011 Census, giving it a 10% weightage compared with 17.5% for the 1971 Census. The 15th Finance Commission, on the other hand, does not take into account the 1971 Census at all. Thomas Isaac, finance minister of Left Front-ruled Kerala, says the Bharatiya Janata Party , which heads a coalition government at the Centre, does not believe in diversity or in federalism. “It is using this opportunity to further centralise the governance structure in India. It is undemocratic.” He questions the Finance Commission’s proposal to consider states’ expenditure on “populist” measures. 




Another criterion is states’ implementation of the Centre’s flagship schemes. “There has been a trend to impose more conditionalities on the state, forcing the Centre’s vision of development on states.” (See “BJP Doesn’t Believe in Diversity or Federalism”) Rajeev Gowda, academic and Congress MP in Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, concurs. “Every state has its own schemes as well as central schemes. So why should we be ranked on the basis of implementation of central schemes?” EAS Sarma, a former Union finance secretary, believes the spirit of cooperative federalism has been violated. “The very fact that there has been no consultation is the problem.” The BJP is not in power in any of the southern states, and Karnataka is the only state it has ruled in the past (it was a junior partner in the ruling coalition in Andhra Pradesh). 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has termed these criticisms baseless and said that the Union government has suggested incentivising states that have controlled population growth. 


But Isaac is not convinced: “The incentives the PM is talking about... would altogether add 2-3% to the whole award. How can this compensate for the loss that certain states are going to face if the base year is shifted? He is trying to mislead the country.” Isaac says the southern finance ministers are planning to meet again in Vijayawada on May 6, hopefully joined by representatives from West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab and Delhi. 

More Autonomy 
In March, Siddaramaiah wrote a long Facebook post, pushing for more autonomy for states. “From a union of states, we are evolving into a federation of states. Therefore, I don’t think the demands for greater federal autonomy and recognition of regional identity are inconsistent with our nation.” 

He went on to add that the southern states are subsidising the north. “Six states south of the Vindhyas contribute more taxes and get less. For example, for every one rupee of tax contributed by Uttar Pradesh that state receives Rs 1.79. For every one rupee of tax contributed by Karnataka, the state receives Rs 0.47.” 

Siddaramaiah also referred to his government’s move to have a separate flag for the state, which has led many to question the motive. But Gowda finds no reason for alarm. “We are not secessionist. It’s just that we want to celebrate our culture and language. We can be proud Kannadigas and proud Indians at the same time.” 

In the same month, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) working president MK Stalin said that he hoped that the southern states join hands to demand autonomy for a Dravida Nadu. Shiv Visvanathan, professor at the Jindal Global Law School, does not see this as an attempt to secede. “It is a demand for a new kind of distancing in federalism.” The DMK , in its initial years, had called for a separate state, a demand it subsequently gave up. 

Another instance of a southern state crying foul about unfair treatment by the Centre is Andhra which is piqued about not getting special category status (SCS), which was promised when erstwhile Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated in 2014, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power. Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu recently pulled his Telugu Desam Party out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance over this issue. Between 1969 and 2010, 11 states were granted SCS, which considered factors such as economic backwardness, hilly terrain and low population density. But the NDA government has repeatedly referred to the 14th Finance Commission’s recommendation to do away with SCS — which meant grants from the Centre and tax concessions — and replace it with revenue-deficit grants. 

The government has promised Andhra a special package equivalent to SCS, but with Naidu’s opponent, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, gaining political capital out of the issue, Naidu had no option but to pull out of the NDA, keeping next year’s assembly election in mind. 

Another state election has aggravated Tamil anger in the Cauvery issue. The Modi government has failed to form the Cauvery Water Management Board, as mandated by the Supreme Court in its February verdict on the sharing of Cauvery waters between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (Kerala and Puducherry are the other riparian states). The Centre sought three more months from the apex court, citing the Karnataka assembly election, which is to be held on May 12. But the Centre was later reprimanded by the Supreme Court for missing the March 29 deadline and was asked to submit a plan by May 3. 

The agitation by Tamil Nadu’s opposition parties over the Cauvery issue is gathering steam; Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) leader Vaiko’s nephew died of self-immolation. The protests have led to the Indian Premier League matches being moved out of Chennai. 

Maalan V Narayanan, a senior journalist in Chennai, believes the latest Cauvery protests are interesting as “Karnataka has not come into the picture. It’s an anti-Centre agitation”. Narayanan adds that while the anti-Hindi cause is still taken up by some fringe Tamil nationalist parties, it is no longer part of the mainstream discourse. However, he says, there is a perception that the Centre is ruling by proxy in Tamil Nadu through its influence over the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( AIADMK ). 

Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam has admitted that he merged his breakaway group with the ruling faction of AIADMK on Modi’s advice. AIADMK has been in flux since its chief J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. TTK Dhinakaran, the nephew of Jayalalithaa’s jailed acolyte VK Sasikala, has floated a new party after winning the bypoll to the assembly constituency represented by Jayalalithaa. 

The BJP, a non-entity in Tamil Nadu, has been trying to capitalise on the political vacuum in the state left by Jayalalithaa’s passing, and her rival and DMK chief M Karunanidhi’s dotage. “The BJP wants a single religion and a single cultural entity, which we are against,” says DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan. Sarma believes the acceptance in the South of cultural elements from outside the region has to be organic, as has happened with Hindi through the popularity of Bollywood movies. 

If the BJP has not endeared itself to voters in Tamil Nadu with the AIADMK fiasco, its national secretary H Raja’s comments have only made things worse. In October 2017, he launched an attack on actor Vijay after the latter’s character in the film Mersal criticised the goods and services tax. Raja said the actor is a Christian and the film was a hate campaign against Modi. 

Last month Raja again stirred up a hornets’ nest when he called for “caste fanatic” EV Ramasamy’s statues to be demolished. Ramasamy, or Periyar as he is better known, was the founder of the Self-Respect Movement, to which both the DMK and AIADMK trace their origins. After Raja’s Facebook post, two men were held for vandalising a Periyar statue in Vellore, near Chennai. Earlier this week, Raja was in the news for insinuating on Twitter that Kanimozhi is Karunanidhi’s illegitimate daughter. Raja did not respond to ET Magazine’s calls and messages. The BJP has also been trying to bolster its presence in Kerala, where it managed to have its first ever MLA elected in the 2016 election. But in May 2017, when the Centre banned the sale of cattle for slaughter at animal markets, there were “beef protests” in Kerala and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Modi, saying the move was “against the principles of federalism and secularism”. 

PS Sreedharan Pillai, former president of the BJP in Kerala, terms the state government’s opposition to the ToR a political move. “In Kerala, there is a mania (among the Left) against the BJP. Cordial relationship between the Centre and states is the need of the hour.” He says the opposition to cattle slaughter ban, too, was politically motivated. “For the sake of power, they are creating apprehension among minorities.” 

South vs Centre 
In these cases, it is not as much a divide between the South and the North as it is between the southern states and the Union government or between the states and the BJP. Visvanathan feels the divide is partly rhetorical because politicians realise the mobilising power of such sloganeering. 

Even if the states find common cause against the Centre, expecting them to put up a united front is unrealistic. The absence of Telangana and Tamil Nadu at the finance ministers’ meeting in Thiruvananthapuram was a case in point. Moreover, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have been at loggerheads for a long time on the Cauvery issue. So have Tamil Nadu and Kerala been on the Mullaperiyar dam on the Periyar river. Similarly, Andhra and Telangana are locked in a dispute over sharing the Krishna waters. 

Regardless of whether there is reason to suggest an actual North-South divide, the friction between the southern states and the Centre will continue, exacerbated by the BJP’s rise, if at all, in states other than Karnataka.

It is a matter of concern that Synthite Industries with a turnover of Rs 1,800 crore has been forced to contemplate shifting their business from Kerala to a favourable location.
“It is saddening to note that a company, established in the year 1972 and currently providing direct employment to over 2,500 people is contemplating a drastic move such as this over the unpleasant turn of events leading to disruption of their business by the direct actions of a prominent trade union of the State.
This needs to be resolved with a view to protect the industry”, Shaji Varghese, president of the Chamber said on Saturday.
Mr Varghese said that the Chief Minister should intervene immediately to settle the matter. “At a time when every state in the country is working overtime to attract investments, it is unthinkable that a state would allow a company like Synthite Industries to move away from here. The Government must act and act now”, he added.
The agitation is completely against the attempt by the Chief Minister to create a business friendly image of the state.",english
